Alvina,Introduction,"Is it not so that thou art new? Thou fared well to find me. But cometh thee not for the grave of Sir Artorias? My advice true, forget this! The legend of Artorias art none but a fabrication. ...Traversing the dark? 'Tis but a fairy tale. Have thine own respect, go not yonder knocking for nothing, I say!"
Alvina,"Answering ""Yes""","Well indeed, thou art a strange one! Nevertheless, I feel some liking for thee. I'm Alvina of the Darkroot Wood. I command a clan of hunters who track down defilers of the forest graves. What dost thou say? Wilt thou not join us? Oh yes, I believe we would suit thee well."
Alvina,"Answering ""No""","Hmm, I see. A result most heathenish and gross. Then there is nothing more to say about this tedious reckoning. Be gone from here. Pernicious caitiff."
Alvina,"Answering ""Yes"" to joining covenant""","I am very glad! And now thou art one of us! Let us establish a Covenant. And here, taketh this ring. If thou weareth that ring, it allows for thine summoning. If mine senses reveal intruders, then I will summon thee. Fend them off sir, I beseech only this. I shall summon others, who will by their honour work tirelessly with thee. Thou shalt receive great reward, and whatsoever ye shall pillage will be thine own. A true agreement, not so? But thou must heed the golden rule... The clan is thine own family. To thine kinsmen forever stay true. Dare'st not in any attempt to double-cross. Have no doubt, such wretchedness, never will we tolerate."
Alvina,"Answering ""No"" to joining covenant","Oh, I see. 'Tis a pity indeed. But this is thine stubborn choice alone. I cannot enforce it upon thee. If thine mind should be alter'd, forsooth speak to me once more."
Alvina,Randomly speaking with Alvina,"Ah, thou dost cometh. How fares ye? My hopes for thee are of the highest. Do not such a hope shatter with foul disproportion."
Alvina,Speaking with Alvina after killing an intruder,"Ah, thou dost cometh. My hopes for thee are of the highest. Do not such a hope shatter with foul disproportion. Ah yes, here is thine reward. It is for thee, take it. Make no attempt to show thineself as Hollow!"
Alvina,Speaking with Alvina after killing 3 intruders,"Oh, thou art present! I have heard murmuring about thee. I like that which I hear! I felt of thou indeed as a special one! The very moment mine eyes first set upon thee. Here's a precious reward. It is for thee, take it. May thine skill earn thee many more!"
Alvina,Alvina speaking of her distrust of Shiva,"Perchance... Hast thou met Shiva? A lad cometh from the far East, strong of arm; now a clan leader of ours. ...And yet.. Still I feel that boy hides something. Of that I am certain. Small fear that he will use us badly... Yet on guard we must stay. And that man that clingeth to Shiva like some shadow...ensure thou dost treat him with the same caution."
Alvina,Betraying the covenant,"Oh, it is thee... Thine kinsmen are betrayed by thee. This doth bode most badly. No rest will ease thy rotten soul whilst there is one clansman living... Forever tormented thou shalt be by our very howls... Hellish villain, thou hast used us most foully, thine own family... For thee, no mercy shall be shown."
Alvina,Attacking her,"Dee hee hee, dee hee hee! What a fool we have, what a wretched fool we have! Oh, it is thee... Thine kinsmen are betrayed by thee. This doth bode most badly. No rest will ease thy rotten soul whilst there is one clansman living... Forever tormented thou shalt be by our very howls..."
Anastacia of Astora,Upon being revived,"...Th, thank you...I am Anastacia of Astora...Now I can continue my duty as a Keeper...But...I only hope that my impure tongue does not offend."
Anastacia of Astora,Talk,"...Forgive me...I am impure, my tongue never intended for restoration...Please, if you have any heart...Leave me be...I wish not to speak..."
Anastacia of Astora,After given at least one Lord Soul to the Lordvessel,"(... Frampt has told me of you...*) That you have agreed to link the Fire... I thank you, sincerely... Finally the curse of the Undead will be lifted, and I can die human... I am powerless, but I will do what I can... Please, save us all... Please."
Andre of Astora,Introduction,"Well, you must be a new arrival. I'm Andre of Astora. If you require smithing, speak to me."
Andre of Astora,Farewell,I'll be seeing you then. Be careful out there.
Andre of Astora,Farewell (after buying),"Don't get yourself killed, neither of us wants to see you go Hollow."
Andre of Astora,Greeting,"Well, hello again. You seem to be doing all right. Need anything forged?"
Andre of Astora,Talk x1,"Most weapons and armor are mighty sturdy indeed. But every hunk of metal has its breaking point. If you notice durability running low, it's time to repair. You can ask a blacksmith like meself, or do it on your own with a grindstone. The nice thing about weapons...they never betray you. So pay them a little respect, eh?"
Andre of Astora,Talk x2,"There are two types of weapon reinforcing. There's reinforcement, and there's ascension. Reinforcement is simple. It strengthens the weapon and nothing more. A simple task for any blacksmith. Hell, you could even do it yourself with a smithbox. But ascension is a finer art. It alters a weapon properties. Ascension is the territory of we blacksmiths; a smithbox just won't do the trick. Start out with reinforcement. When that loses it's charm you can consider ascension. As you've noticed, this land is flush with the mad and wicked. You won't make it through the night without employing my services. Hah hah hah!"
Andre of Astora,Talk x3,"You can forge armour just like you do weapons. Forging armour is even easier than forging weapons. Whether you forge armor or weapons first? Well that's up to you. But nobody wants to see you go Hollow. So, whatever you do, you'd better do it well. Hah hah hah!"
Andre of Astora,Talk x4,"This is the old church. It was abandoned in favour of the church that you passed through. There are paths leading from here to two forbidden planes: Sen's Fortress, and Darkroot Garden. They attract all sorts of lunatics, no-one as cultured as yourself. It's fine to be Undead, but keep a level head, eh? Hah hah hah!"
Andre of Astora,Talk x5,"Sen's Fortress is an old proving ground built by the ancient gods. It is the only route to the great Anor Londo. Of course, most fools can't even find their way into that fortified deathtrap. But they won't stop trying! Take that bumbling Sir Onion... Hah hah hah!"
Andre of Astora,Talk x6,"I know little of the Darkroot Garden. Although, I've heard rumours of a divine blacksmith who resides there. Those who get stumped in the Catacombs seek him for divine weapons."
Andre of Astora,Talk x7 (after retrieving the Divine Ember),"Oh, yes, and one more thing about the Darkroot Garden. It is said to house the grave of Sir Artorias the Abysswalker. Only, of those who ventured into the forest, none has returned."
Andre of Astora,Large Ember,"Ahh, why, that's a fine ember you have there. I could smith some mighty weapons with one of those. Why not lend it to me?"
Andre of Astora,Very Large Ember,"Well, I'll be! That's a brilliant ember you've got there! For all my years in the trade, that might be the finest! How's about... you leave that ember with me? I'm just an old smith. I'd give my left arm for a gem like that."
Andre of Astora,Divine Ember,"My, that's a rare ember you have there. I've seen one of those before... It's the ember of a divine blacksmith. Might you consider leaving that with me? I could produce divine weapons with a flame such as that."
Andre of Astora,Large Divine Ember,"Oh, my, what a brilliant ember you have there. I've only heard legends of such specimens... The embers used for the secret rites of divine blacksmiths... Perhaps you could lend it to me? I've long dreamed of forging divine weapons..."
Andre of Astora,Dark Ember,"Hrm? Show me that ember of yours... Well, I've never heard of a black ember. Hmmm... How about leaving that ember with me? I find it strangely fascinating."
Andre of Astora,"Saying ""No"" to giving Andre an ember","I see... 'Tis a pity... But perhaps you'd... No, no, it's quite all right... Quite all right, indeed..."
Andre of Astora,Bringing him an ember he can't use,"Hmm, that's an odd ember you have there. Ahh, I know what you're thinking. But I'm no good with those. It won't be easy, but... I'm afraid you'll have to look for someone else."
Andre of Astora,Attacking him,"Well you've got some nerve! Coming at me like that! I'll tear you to shreds, you bloody hollow!"
Andre of Astora,Killing him,"Curses, you damn backstabber."
Big Hat Logan,Introduction,"Mm, you seem quite lucid! A rare thing in these times. I am Logan. I'm a bit cooped up, as you can see. I have a bright idea. Suppose you set me free. I'm old and empty-handed, but I could repay you with knowledge, and sorcery. This place is melting my mind. The inactivity is repressive."
Big Hat Logan,Unlock his cage,"Oh, heavens, thank you. I'm saved. And, I'd love to resume my travels, but I must log a few things first, and I owe you a favour. I will return to Firelink Shrine. Speak with me there, so that I may impart my sorcery."
Big Hat Logan,Right after unlocking his cage,"Oh, hello. Don't mind me. Go on ahead. I'll be along later. Phoo-hah-hah, I'll be just fine, young one."
Big Hat Logan,At Firelink Shrine,There you are. I was expecting you. As promised I will share my sorceries.
Big Hat Logan,Speaking at Firelink Shrine having 14 or less intelligence,"There you are. I was expecting you. As promised I will share my sorceries... I am afraid that you are unable to learn sorcery. The basic framework, you see. It cannot be taught. Oh, do not fret. Life isn't all about sorcery. You will find your own way. Don't frown with regret; peer forward with your head held high."
Big Hat Logan,Speaking after acquiring 15 or more intelligence,Hello there. Glad to see you alive. Hmmm... It seems you've come quite a way. Excellent. You are certainly ready. I shall teach you sorceries.
Big Hat Logan,Greeting at Firelink,Hello there. You really are very diligent. I quite understand. Study is invigorating!
Big Hat Logan,Farewell at Firelink,"Heading out, are you? I, too, will leave soon. Undead or no, I shan't stay here forever. You have great potential. Don't go and die over nothing."
Big Hat Logan,The Duke's Archives Prison Cell,"Hello again! What a chance meeting this is! Alas I'm imprisoned once again. I don't suppose you could stage me a getaway? The Archives, such a storehouse of knowledge. So close, but just out of reach! The thought offends me so, I simply could die! As a student of the arts, you understand me, yes?"
Big Hat Logan,Unlocking his Cell Door,"Oh, thank you very much. I'm saved. That makes twice. I must be sure to repay you. I will visit the Archives. If I discover any new spells, I shall share them with you. Prepare to be impresses, by the onward march of sorcery!"
Big Hat Logan,Speaking to him after unlocking door,Hello. Don't mind me. Go on ahead. I'll head out soon. I wish to lay down my plans before I visit the Archives.
Big Hat Logan,The Duke's Archives Library,"Hello there. I was expecting you. This place is truly magnificent, more than expected even. As promised, I shall share the new sorceries with you. And the secret of Seath's immortality."
Big Hat Logan,Talk x1,"Ah, the secret of Seath's immortality? If you have fought him, and were imprisoned, you must know that Seath is a true Undead, different from ourselves. His wounds close promptly, and no mortal blow affects him, granting true insulation from death. It is an effect of the Primordial Crystal, a sacred treasure pillaged by Seath when he turned upon the ancient dragons. So, only by destroying the Primordial Crystal can you so much as scratch his hide. And it so happens, the Primordial Crystal is in the inner garden of these very archives, the Crystal Forest."
Big Hat Logan,Talk x2,"The tomes stored in these Archives are truly magnificent. A great pool of knowledge, the fruits of superior wisdom and an unquenchable desire for the truth. Some would say Seath had an unsound fixation... But his work is a beautiful, invaluable resource. All progress demands sacrifice. And I certainly bear no antipathy for that wonderful scaleless beast."
Big Hat Logan,Archive Library Greeting 1x,"Hello there. You really are very diligent. Oh, I understand. We are in the midst of a revolution!"
Big Hat Logan,Archive Library Greeting 2x,Oh hello there. Where have you been? Time is a resource. Let's delve in promptly.
Big Hat Logan,Archive Library Farewell 1x,"Come again. The knowledge here is limitless. I will absorb it, then share it with you."
Big Hat Logan,Archive Library Farewell 2x,Farewell.
Big Hat Logan,Archive Library Farewell 3x,"Come again, any time you please. For I too, learn, whilst teaching a student."
Big Hat Logan,After Defeating Seath,"Oh there you are, it has been a while. Or, were you just here? This fascinating place defeats my sense of time..."
Big Hat Logan,Talk After Defeating Seath,Mm...mm...(Gibberish)
Big Hat Logan,Farewell After Defeating Seath,Mm...mm...(Gibberish)
Big Hat Logan,After buying all spells he has to offer,...Who are you...Stay clear...stay clear of my work...Curses upon you!...How dare you disturb me!
Big Hat Logan,Attacking Logan before he goes insane,"I fail to see your design, but if you think I'm too old to defend myself, perhaps some sorcery will change you mind!"
Big Hat Logan,Killing Logan before he goes insane,Heavens... the folly of youth...I'm too old for this...
Crestfallen Merchant,Introduction,"Ah, what? What? Who are you? Ahh another Undead, eh? I took on Sen's Fortress alone... But I'm no different from those vile creatures... I was driven by conceit... Ahh, you think you're different? That you can handle it? Yes, I remember that feeling. For I was the same... So let me help you out. With your souls searching."
Crestfallen Merchant,Talk x1,"There's nothing more to say. I'm finished. We're both on the brink, you see? End of story. You bloody fool."
Crestfallen Merchant,Talk x2,"Let me give a nibble of advice. Don't even consider visiting Anor Londo. Not in your state. For a century, they have tried, and failed. The Knight King Rendal, Black Iron Tarkus, and even Logan himself. You won't stand a chance. You'll be eaten alive. But, go along, if you wish. If only to deepen your despair!"
Crestfallen Merchant,Leaving without purchase,"Nothing at all? Fine then, rush in like a naked babe, and be skinned alive."
Crestfallen Merchant,Greetings,"...(Grunting) Hm...Oh, yes, it's you. What is it? Still something you need, eh, anything at all?"
Crestfallen Merchant,Leaving after making a purchase,"Go along, try and make something of yourself. But nothing will come of it. And I should know"
Crestfallen Merchant,Talk x3,Where do I get all my things? Stripped off the corpses of fools like yourself. It isn't easy. I have to catch them just before they go Hollow. Don't worry. I'll be there to claim your trinkets. Gazing at your final twisted grimace. Gee hee hee hee hee!
Crestfallen Merchant,Leaving abruptly,...Hmm?
Crestfallen Merchant,Speaking after abruptly leaving,"...Hm, fine, fine. I understand. I have my head about me."
Crestfallen Merchant,Attacking him,What the devils got into you? Hrrgrrrrroooggh! You hrggraaaghh!
Crestfallen Merchant,Killing him,Hrrggahh...Ahhh...help me...
Crestfallen Warrior,Introduction,"Well, what do we have here? You must be a new arrival. Let me guess. Fate of the Undead, right? Well, you're not the first. But there's no salvation here. You'd have done better to rot in the Undead Asylum... But, too late now. Well, since you're here... Let me help you out. There are actually two Bells of Awakening. One's up above, in the Undead Church. The other is far, far below, in the ruins at the base of Blighttown. Ring them both, and something happens... Brilliant, right? Not much to go on, but I have a feeling that won't stop you. So, off you go. It is why you came, isn't it? To this accursed land of the Undead? Hah hah hah hah..."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking to him when in Hollow form,"Oh, your face! You're practically Hollow! But who knows, going Hollow could solve quite a bit! Hah hah hah hah..."
Crestfallen Warrior,After speaking to him in Hollow form,"Hm, what? Restoring your humanity? Well, there are a few ways to go about it... Collect it bit by bit from corpses, or you can butter up a cleric, and get yourself summoned. And the quickest way, although I'd never do it, is to kill a healthy Undead, and pillage its humanity. Coveting thy neighbor is only human, after all! Hah hah hah hah..."
Crestfallen Warrior,After explaining how to become human again,What are you looking at? Don't try anything clever. You might regret it.
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking after introduction,"Hm? What, you want to hear more? Oh, that's all we need. Another inquisitive soul. Well, listen carefully, then... One of the bells is up above in the Undead Church, but the lift is broken. You'll have to climb the stairs up the ruins, and access the Undead Burg through the waterway. The other bell is back down below the Undead Burg, within the plague-infested Blighttown. But I'd die again before I step foot in that cesspool! Hah hah hah hah!"
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking to him too much,"Bloody hell, what is it now? You ask too many questions."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking after ringing the first Bell of Awakening,"Why, what a surprise. I didn't expect you to make it. ...Oh somebody rang the bell...Wait. Was it you? You never give up, do you? I don't know how you do it. Well, don't stop now."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking after ringing the second Bell of Awakening,"Did you ring the second bell? That is incredible, I must say...But now we have a new problem. It's noisy, it snores, and its breath is lethal... This is no laughing matter, I tell you."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking to him again after ringing second bell,"Damn, that stench... And I was really beginning to like it here! (Sigh) Maybe it's time I do something about it..."
Crestfallen Warrior,"Speaking to him after Reah, Vince, and Nico arrive","Did you see her? That virtuous little maiden, complete with followers in tow. They're probably going straight to pillage graves. I've heard enough about ""M'Lady"" for a lifetime."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking about the Giant Crow,"You again? There's nothing to speak about, really. Oh, actually...Something strange did happen. That crow flew off with somebody in its clutches. I think it was a man curled up in a ball. Stranger things have happened, right? No, maybe not..."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking before Griggs is rescued,"How did that silly sorcerer's apprentice end up? You know, the one always prattling on about Master Logan. He left for the Undead Burg, but never came back. Serves him right. If even Old Big Hat can't make it out there, what chance does he have? I hope he enjoys his new life as a Hollow."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking after Griggs is rescued,"How did that nutty sorcerer make it back? Unexpected, but I suppose stranger things have happened."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking before Laurentius is rescued,"How did that raggedy old chum end up? You know, the one who idolized some godmother of pyromancy. He left for Blighttown, but never came back. Whereas most flee from sickness, he dives right in. Well, nothing will harm him once he goes Hollow."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking after Laurentius is rescued,"How did that old man make it back? Unexpected, but I suppose stranger things have happened."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking about New Londo,"Have you been to the ruins of New Londo below? Just head down the stairs, and take the lift. It's certainly worth a visit. It was once an Undead city. You may find a clue or two. Unless the ghosts find you first... Keh heh heh heh!"
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking after seeing Anastacia,"Oh, have you seen that terribly morose lass? ...The Fire Keeper. She's stuck keeping that bonfire lit. Sad, really. She's mute and bound to this forsaken place. They probably cut her tongue out back in her village, so that she'd never say any god's name in vain. How do these martyrs keep chugging along? I'd peter out in an instant. Hah hah hah hah!"
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking after Reah is rescued in Tomb of the Giants,"Did you hear about the maiden? The virtuous lass came back alone, and in absolute tatters... Did her followers die, or was she abandoned? Who knows. But I suppose we've heard the last from ""M'Lady"". Hah hah hah hah!"
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking about Reah's location,That maiden? She's shuffled off somewhere. I believe to the Undead Church. These ruins were probably too awkward for her.
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking to him randomly,What's wrong? Get a bit of a scare out there? No problem. Have a seat and get comfortable. We'll both be Hollow before you know it. Hah hah hah hah...
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking to him if cursed,"Oi, hold on... Don't tell me, have you been cursed? Oh woe is the Undead who's cursed on top of it all! Harsh times; harsh times, indeed! Hah hah hah hah! Hah hah hah hah! No, no, I'm sorry. Here, let me share a nice tip. Long ago, I was told of a remedician who resides in New Londo. Does he really exist? Well, go and find out for yourself. But don't blame me if he's just an apparition! Hah hah hah hah!"
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking after Big Hat Logan is rescued,"Oi, did you see him? Big Hat Logan, the legendary sorcerer, in the flesh! ...This place is simply mad... Legendary heroes popping up left and right... They're making me feel quite inadequate, to be honest! Hah hah hah hah..."
Crestfallen Warrior,Speaking about forging weapons,"Don't you ever think to forge your weapons? You'd better find a smithbox soon, unless you enjoy swinging about with blunt instruments! Hah hah hah hah!"
Crestfallen Warrior,Attacking him,"Lousy rat! You have some nerve! I may be crestfallen, but I'm not defenseless, you rascal! You will soon regret this!"
Crestfallen Warrior,Being killed by him,"Now, that's just embarrassing. How'd you let me do that to you?"
Crestfallen Warrior,Killing him,"Heheh, not too shabby... not too shabby... I think you've done me a favour..."
Crossbreed Priscilla,Greeting,"Who art thou? One of us, thou art not. If thou hast misstepped into this world, plunge down from the plank, and hurry home. If thou seekest I, thine desires shall be requited not."
Crossbreed Priscilla,Talk,"Thou must returneth whence thou came. This land is peaceful, its inhabitants kind, but thou dost not belong. I beg of thee, plunge down from the plank, and hurry home."
Crossbreed Priscilla,Attacking her,I expected as much from thee. Why dost thee hurry toward thine death?
Crossbreed Priscilla,Killing the player,Why could thou not let us be? Didst thou not see why Ariamis created this world?
Crossbreed Priscilla,Killing her,"Ahh... But, why... What seeketh thee?"
Dark Sun Gwyndolin,After killing Gwynevere,"Thou that tarnished the Godmother's image. I am Gwyndolin, and thy transgression shall not go unpunished. Thou shalt perish in the twilight of Anor Londo."
Dark Sun Gwyndolin,Entering the fog after killing Gwynevere,"Heretic... First thou offendeth the Godmother, and now thou see fit to trample upon the tomb of the Great Lord. I am the Darksun, Gwyndolin! Let the atonement for thy felonies commenceth!"
Dark Sun Gwyndolin,Killing him,"O Heretic, swathed in Dark... An eternal curse upon thee..."
Dark Sun Gwyndolin,Entering the fog as a member of the Blade of the Darkmoon,"What foolishness... Why would a Blade of the Darkmoon trespasseth upon the Great Lord's tomb? Mark the words of mineself, Gwyndolin! Thou shalt not go unpunished!"
Darkmoon Knightess,Introduction,"Well, you are a rare visitor. Welcome to the lost city of Anor Londo, chosen Undead. If you seek Lord Gwyn's old keep, exit here and head straight yonder. If you are the chosen one, a revelation shall visit thee. ...What follows thereafter, depends upon you..."
Darkmoon Knightess,Speaking to her after receiving the Lordvessel,"Hmm. So, you have received a revelation? Very auspicious. I hope for the best. I pray that through you, Her wish will be granted."
Darkmoon Knightess,Talk x1,"Have you heard of Seath the Scaleless? In legend, he turned against the ancient dragons. He became Lord Gwyn's confidant, was granted dukedom, and was allowed to pursue his research. At the Regal Archives, he immersed himself in research on scales of immortality, the one thing that he did not have. ...But his very research drove him mad... The Archives became a dungeon, a place for sinister experiments. Now, nobody dares even approach the duke's forbidden Archives. It looms over this land, high atop the mountain. But I should warn against even an approach..."
Darkmoon Knightess,Talk x2,"Hm, what is it? What am I? Well...I am the Keeper of the bonfire. If not for me, what beacon would there be in this lost city? A gatekeeper, and a guide; that is my calling."
Darkmoon Knightess,Talk x3,"The bonfires attended by the Keepers are special. They are linked to one another, and their flames never die. Yet never shall the Keepers of these flames meet..."
Darkmoon Knightess,Talk x4,"If you require rest, now is the time. That is, after all, what the bonfire is for."
Darkmoon Knightess,Greetings,"Go ahead, you may rest here. Even an Undead requires repose."
Darkmoon Knightess,Speaking to her after becoming a Blade of the Darkmoon,"Oh...You are one of us. That is a surprise. But a pleasant one. We are both Blades of the Darkmoon, now. I shall look forward to fighting alongside you."
Darkmoon Knightess,Approaching her after killing Gwynevere,"So... It was you, was it? How dare you produce a blade upon a deity? How did you ever get this far? I shall end your suffering here and now. It is the least that I can do. What you saw under light of the Darkmoon shall haunt you forever."
Darkmoon Knightess,Attacking her,What! How dare you! Hrk! Rrgh! Very well. So be it. Expunging fools like you is part of my charge...
Darkmoon Knightess,Killing her,"But, how... This man* is a threat... Master Gwyndolin..."
Darkstalker Kaathe,Introduction,"Greetings, Undead warrior. I am the primordial serpent Darkstalker Kaathe. I can guide thee, and illuminate the truth. Undead Warrior, conqueror of the Four Kings; is this not your wish? To know the truth of men, and the Undead?"
Darkstalker Kaathe,"Answering ""Yes""","A wise choice, Undead warrior. Prove you must, that the truth becomes you. Seek Anor Londo. And claim Gwyn's heirloom, the Lordvessel. Now go, Undead warrior. Show the world that the truth becomes you. (Note: This dialogue may be different if the player has already acquired the Lordvessel.)"
Darkstalker Kaathe,"Answering ""No""",...Very well. Warriors as yourself are few. I will be patient. But I cannot wait forever...
Darkstalker Kaathe,"After answering ""No""","What is it? Perhaps you have changed your mind? (The Answering ""Yes"" dialogue will now be said.)"
Darkstalker Kaathe,After acquiring the Lordvessel,"Hmm... You are astonishing. The truth I shall share, without sentiment. After the advent of Fire, the ancient Lords found the three souls. But your progenitor found a fourth, unique soul. The Dark Soul. Your ancestor claimed the Dark Soul, and waited for Fire to subside. And soon, the flames did fade, and only Dark remained. Thus began the age of men, the Age of Dark. However... Lord Gwyn trembled at the Dark. Clinging to his Age of Fire, and in dire fear of humans, and the Dark Lord who would one day be born amongst them, Lord Gwyn resisted the course of nature. By sacrificing himself to link the Fire, and commanding his children to shepherd the humans, Gwyn has blurred your past, to prevent the birth of the Dark Lord. I am the primordial serpent. I seek to right the wrongs of the past, to discover our true Lord. But the other serpent, Frampt, lost his sense, and befriended Lord Gwyn. Undead Warrior, we stand at a crossroads. Only I know the truth about your fate. You must destroy the fading Lord Gwyn, who has coddled Fire and resisted nature, and become the Fourth Lord, so that you may usher in an Age of Dark."
Darkstalker Kaathe,"Answering ""Yes""","Very well! I shall now guide you to Gwyn's prison. Be still. Entrust thine flesh to me. *Kaathe will take the player to Firelink Altar.* This is Gwyn's prison. Now, place the Lordvessel upon the altar."
Darkstalker Kaathe,"Answering ""No""","Fool... You could not be the Dark Lord. Enough of this...and farewell to you. I shall return to the Abyss, and await the true Lord of Men."
Darkstalker Kaathe,After placing the Lordvessel,"Very well. Once the vessel is filled with souls, the gate to Gwyn shall open. Seek Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith, and the traitor Seath the Scaleless. Fill this vessel with their souls. Then, the gate will open... so that you may kill Gwyn. ... Are you ready? Then, let us return to the Abyss. Entrust thine flesh to me."
Darkstalker Kaathe,Greetings,"What is it? I am your guardian. Go on, state your wish."
Darkstalker Kaathe,Darkwraith Covenant Entry,"Ahh... If you wish, I shall grant the art of Lifedrain, the legendary power of the Dark Lord. It can preserve your humanity while Undead, and cast off the shackles placed upon your brethren."
Darkstalker Kaathe,Talking before acquiring the Lordvessel,Undead warrior. To speak now is premature. It begins with your retrieval of the Lordvessel.
Darkstalker Kaathe,Talk x1 after placing the Lordvessel,"They failed me, every last one of them. They were strong, but saw not the truth... I am certain that you will prove different."
Darkstalker Kaathe,Farewell,Farewell.
Domhnall of Zena,Introduction,"Aye, siwmae. And good day to you. I'm Domhnall of Zena. I'm just, well, a peddler, of sorts. I adore trinkets and oddities, so I trade for them."
Domhnall of Zena,Greetings,"Aye, siwmae. We meet again. Found anything special for my good self? Mmm, I certainly hope so!"
Domhnall of Zena,Farewell after purchasing,"Heh heh. Thank you. That was a fine trade. I have this funny feeling we'll meet again soon. And we'll make another fine trade, of course!"
Domhnall of Zena,Farewell without purchasing,"Well, that is a shame, then. But no matter. No, not to worry. Come back again. I'm always available. Not every trade was meant to be. There'll be more in store for us, someday, sometime!"
Domhnall of Zena,Tip given when talking after purchasing,"So, I am willing to share some tips. If you seek Kindling in the Catacombs, use divine weapons. That will repel the reassembling skeletons."
Domhnall of Zena,Tip given after defeating a boss and purchasing,"Hmm... Well, I'm certain we will make a good trade eventually... So, I am willing to share some tips. The cursed Ghosts of New Londo are formidable foes. To face them, you will require special arms... Or a cursed body. The quickest way to be cursed? Try the bug-eyed lizards in the sewer. Desperate measures, to be sure..."
Domhnall of Zena,Tip only given at Firelink Shrine,"Hmm... You are a fine trading partner. Rumour it may be, but I have heard of a surviving ancient dragon who resides in this land. A coterie of Undead serves the dragon, as they train to become dragons themselves. Sounds unlikely, but you never know, do you?"
Domhnall of Zena,Talk without purchasing,"Hmm... I'm afraid I don't see anything here. Hmm...Well, I'm certain we will make a good trade eventually..."
Domhnall of Zena,Attacking him,"Hold on, there! What's this about? Now, stop that! Ouch! Oww! What problem do you have now? I'm a man of peace, idiot! Enough of you, I say, farewell."
Domhnall of Zena,Killing him,By the Lords... why... My precious collection...
Dusk of Oolacile,Introduction,"So, it is thou who rescueth me? Most gracious, I am deeply obliged. I am Dusk of Oolacile. I cometh from an age long before thine...I can not stay here for long. So, before I disappear, allow me to ask one thing. My home, Oolacile, is the home of ancient sorceries. My hope is to pass this profound knowledge to thee, with thine approval. Would this be of assistance to thee?"
Dusk of Oolacile,"Answering ""Yes""","My heartfelt thanks. I am pleased beyond words. Then, I shalt engrave my signature. If thou art in need, pray summon me from my signature. It seems that my time is done. May the great flames guide thee."
Dusk of Oolacile,"Answering ""No""","Yes, of course... I understand well. Pray forgive me. I have overstepped my boundaries. Farewell; another age, another land, beckons me to return. May the flames guide thee."
Dusk of Oolacile,Greetings,I am Dusk of Oolacile. It is an honour to see thee again. I shall follow thine wishes.
Dusk of Oolacile,Talk x1,"For a very long time, I was trapped within the Crystal Golem. From my home I was taken, and banish'd to a plane of distortion. It was there, that thou came to my rescue. Long after I had relinquished all hope. So gleeful was I, my faith reneweth."
Dusk of Oolacile,Talk x2,"The sorceries of Oolacile differ from the magic of thine age. It is difficult to explain...Oolacile sorceries are, what doth one say? They are somewhat... of an approximation. Thine sorceries are more straightforward, negating all but thy self. Dost thou not find some fascination in these discrepancies?"
Dusk of Oolacile,Talk x3,"My home Oolacile was reduced to ashes, long ago, in my time. I have been alone ever since...But to be summon'd thus, and to be of service to thee... It is... most rewarding... Oh, forgive me, such a long-past time is none of thine concern..."
Dusk of Oolacile,Farewell,"If thou art in need, pray summon me again. I only wish to be of some genuine assistance...May the flames guide thee."
Dusk of Oolacile,Attacking her,What dost thou... Whatever for...
Dusk of Oolacile,Killing her,"Ahh... Farewell, my rescuer..."
Dusk of Oolacile,Rescuing her from Manus,...Mmn...ahh...
Dusk of Oolacile,Talk x4 (Summoning her after Manus fight),"...This may strike thine ear as somewhat peculiar, but...Long ago, in my homeland of Oolacile, I was beset by a creature from the Abyss. I would have perished then, were it not for the great knight Artorias. In truth, I saw little of what transpired, for mine senses were already fled! But even still, there was something about Artorias... A certain balance of the humours...That quite perfectly fits your semblance. Heavens, could it be that... ... Oh, dear me. That was Oolacile, many centuries ago. Please excuse my fanciful musings."
Dusk of Oolacile,Talk x5,"Excuse me for such whimsical utterances. Only, it was so very odd...You, and Artorias. I owe my life to each of you. And each seem to share some resonance of sorts...Perhaps it is the nature of true greatness."
Dusk of Oolacile,Talk x6,"I still think on that creature from the Abyss that preyed on me. My faculties were far from lucid, but I quite clearly sensed certain emotions. A wrenching nostalgia, a lost joy, an object of obsession, and a sincere hope to reclaim it... Could these thoughts belong to the beast from the Abyss? But if that were true, then perhaps it is no beast after all? Oh, please forgive my ramblings. It's just that, I wish to know the truth. And no one, not even loving Elizabeth, will tell me."
Eingyi,Introduction,...Oh dear...What have we here? Are you a new servant?
Eingyi,"Answering ""Yes""","(...Hmph. But you have no eggs?*) Bah, no matter. Go along and have audience with Our Fair Lady. I pray that you will mind your manners!"
Eingyi,"Answering ""No""",Then you shall not pass. Away with you!
Eingyi,"Speaking after Answering ""No""","The nerve of you! Be gone, be gone at once!"
Eingyi,Greetings,You again...
Eingyi,Talk x1 Before being infected with eggs,"...There is nothing to say to you...Except...If you lay a hand on the Fair Lady, you should be prepared to face my wrath."
Eingyi,Talk x2 Before being infected with eggs,"There is no time for idle chat. Think only of Our Fair Lady, and what she may need."
Eingyi,Greetings after understanding the Fair Lady's words,"...You, you speak the tongue of the Fair Lady? ... Well, do not be rash with your pride. You have yet to earn my trust. If you try anything funny with the Fair Lady, there will be hell to pay."
Eingyi,Speaking after being infected with eggs,Well! ...Now...you're just like me... Your dedication is fully apparent. Only well...Your head looks awful...Why not try this? I've no use for it any longer.
Eingyi,Greeting after being infected,"Oh, hello. What is it that you need?"
Eingyi,Talk x3 after being infected,"Incidentally, do you have an interest in pyromancy? If you have, I shall share my flame with you."
Eingyi,"Answering ""Yes""","You have served our Fair Lady well. Now, let this strength be yours."
Eingyi,"Answering ""No""","...Well, fine. I will not force you."
Eingyi,Talk x4 after being infected and understanding the Fair Lady,"In all honesty, I am envious. What comfort can I offer, without speaking her tongue?"
Eingyi,Talk x5 after being infected,"Worse than Undead, we are diseased, and unwanted. Like the grime of the Great Swamp. But my dear, Fair Lady! She cried for me... And swallowed the great Blightpus, despite Mistress Quelaag's orders to the contrary."
Eingyi,Talk x6 after being infected,"Below us lies the ruins of the legendary city of Izalith. There, the Molten Giant watches over the Flame of Chaos. Our Fair Lady, and Mistress Quelaag, fled from the ruins. I do not know the details...And I do not ask..."
Eingyi,Talk x7 after being infected,"Have you heard of Lost Quelana? An inhuman witch, who wanders the Poison Swamp. Only no one has ever seen her, so who really knows? But what if she really is another one of the Quelaag sisters? Our Fair Lady would be greatly comforted by her presence."
Eingyi,Attacking him,I knew it! I knew it! You will not get away with this!
Eingyi,Killing him,Hrg...rgggkt...My dear Fair Lady...You are in danger...
Eingyi,Killing Quelaag's Sister,"Why, youuuuu monster…! The Fair lady! What have you done, what have you done! Hrggreeeeeeeeeeh!"
Elizabeth,Introduction,"Well, look at this one. From what far-away age has thou come? Thy scent is very human, indeed...But, not intolerable...Ah, Princess Dusk's saviour. Thine aura is precisely as she described. I thank thee deeply, for rescuing Her Highness. But Princess Dusk is here no longer...snatched away by that horrifying primeval human. And so I must ask...Couldst thou once more play the saviour?"
Elizabeth,"Answering ""Yes""","Thank you. I am Elizabeth, guardian of this sanctuary. Something of a godmother to Princess Dusk. I shall assist thee, to my utmost. For I am one with the sorceries of Oolacile."
Elizabeth,"Answering ""No""","Yes, I understand. We care dearly for princess Dusk, and are apt to blur our boundaries. I am ashamed to have been so imposing. But should thine heart be changed, speak to me again. This sanctuary, and the sorceries of Oolacile, are my domain. My strength could surely assist thee in thy travels."
Elizabeth,Talk x1,"Thou shalt see further on. An abyss was begat of the ancient beast, and threatens to swallow the whole of Oolacile. Knight Artorias came to stop this, but such a hero has nary a murmur of Dark. Without doubt, he will be swallowed by the Abyss, overcome by its utter blackness...Indeed, the Abyss may be unstoppable...Still I have faith, that Princess Dusk may be rescued yet..."
Elizabeth,Talk x2,"Thou art from a time far, far ahead. There are many things I wish to ask...But I know that I must not. The perils of our time are overwhelming enough."
Elizabeth,Talk x3,"Hah hah...Was thine eye, glancing hither? Thou needst not hide thy wonder. I am a mushroom, after all. Hee hee hee..."
Elizabeth,Talk x4,"Not long ago, I had another visitor. A human like thineself, from a far-away time. Only, he was dreadfully odious...And I am afraid that he is still amongst us. He wore a hat and a long black coat..."
Elizabeth,Greetings,Thank goodness thou art safe. What is thy wish? I offer thee my all.
Elizabeth,Leave,May the flames guide thee.
Elizabeth,After rescuing Dusk,"I have awaited thee. Thou hast rescued Princess Dusk,...and rid us of that terrible primeval human. Even halting the spread of the Abyss! I salute the grandeur of thine enterprise. Please, allow me to express my gratitude. I thank thee... as do we all."
Elizabeth,Talk x5,"I will remember thee, but I will keep thy story to myself. This is the best way, for thou art come from a time far ahead. No-one will sing thy praises, but yet thy greatness shall live on. For it shall be my purpose, to remember all thou hast done for us."
Elizabeth,Slain,"But, why... Why... Dear Dusk..."
Giant Blacksmith,Introduction,Who are you? Forge your weapons?
Giant Blacksmith,Greetings,"Mng. Hello. Forge, I can! Strong, I am!"
Giant Blacksmith,Farewell,Cometh soon.
Giant Blacksmith,Talk x1,"You come, I forge, we talk. You good friend. I very happy."
Giant Blacksmith,Talk x2,"You come, I forge. Shiny-shiny. Get shiny from Duke. Forge weapons, make shiny. More happy."
Giant Blacksmith,Talk x3,"Talk, 'tis no good. But forge...very good! I help anytime."
Giant Blacksmith,Talk x4,"Talk, 'tis no good. No-one home. Everyone gone."
Giant Blacksmith,Talk x5,"But you, friend. You talk, I no talk, but happy."
Giant Blacksmith,Leaving abruptly,"Mng, hmng?"
Giant Blacksmith,Returning after leaving abruptly,Hello again.
Giant Blacksmith,Showing the Crystal Ember,Mng. What's that? Shiny-shiny. Give me that. I make weapons shiny.
Giant Blacksmith,"Answering ""Yes""","I hath shiny-shiny, I make weapons shiny!"
Giant Blacksmith,"Answering ""No""","Hmph, tis a pity."
Giant Blacksmith,Attacking him,Oww. Oi! Stop that!
Giant Blacksmith,Killing him,"Angh, uggghh... Nighty-night..."
Griggs of Vinheim,While trapped in the house,"Somebody! Please, let me out of here! Somebody, anybody! Help me! Unlock the door! ...Damn... ...I'm finished... How did this ever happen..."
Griggs of Vinheim,Freeing him,"Brilliant! You opened the door for me! Thank you; I am saved. I thought I might never escape. I am Griggs of Vinheim. A sorcerer of the school. I am much obliged for your assistance. Thanks to you, I may now resume my travels."
Griggs of Vinheim,Talk after freeing him,"Oh, hello. I am fine. I will rest a while, then return to Firelink Shrine. I have my sorcery. And I will be more cautious next time. Besides, I have an important task at hand."
Griggs of Vinheim,Speaking with less than 10 intelligence,"Oh, hello. Terrific to see us both in one piece. And pray that you never go Hollow!"
Griggs of Vinheim,Back at Firelink,"Oh, hello. I regret meeting you under such compromising circumstances. At least we both made it back unscathed. Incidentally, would you care to learn any sorceries? You're clearly talented, and besides, I owe you. Of course we will require some materials, but I am happy to teach you some elementary spells. Are you interested?"
Griggs of Vinheim,"Answering ""Yes""","Splendid! Very well! I am pleased to have a chance to give something back. Well, then lets get started straight away."
Griggs of Vinheim,Talk x1,"It's not that I am concerned for Master Logan's welfare. Even in this treacherous land, Logan's skills are unmatched. He is a true hero. ...No, the reason I seek Logan is... ...Well, it's really my own conceit, now isn't it?"
Griggs of Vinheim,Farewell without any purchase,"Good-bye, then. Do stay safe."
Griggs of Vinheim,Farewell after making a purchase,All right. That'll do it. That should help you on your journey. May we meet again.
Griggs of Vinheim,Greetings after Reah and her companions leave,"Did you see them? The three young clerics... headed for the Catacombs, to seek Kindling. Kindling is the art of feeding bonfires. The poor young girl, sent down into a tomb. What a terrible mission she is burdened with."
Griggs of Vinheim,Greetings after Logan has left,"Oh, there you are! Just so you know... Master Logan has left on his own again. It seems that he is still determined to find the famed Regal Archives in Anor Londo. I intend to search for him. Only, before I leave, there is one thing I wish to do. You see, Master Logan has left most of his books. With them I could teach you Logan's sorcery. ...You have done much to assist me. Before I leave on this journey, I will teach you all that Logan has to share."
Griggs of Vinheim,After Logan has left,"Oh, hello, you made it! Then, let us begin. As promised, I shall bequeath Master Logan's sorcery to you."
Griggs of Vinheim,Attacking him,"Curses, you leave me no choice! You aren't yourself any more. Forgive me!"
Griggs of Vinheim,Killing him,Rrrg... How could this...
"Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight",Entering her throne room,"Thou hast journey'd far, and overcome much, chosen Undead. Come hither, child..."
"Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight",Kneeling to her,"O chosen Undead. I am Gwynevere. Daughter of Lord Gwyn; and Queen of Sunlight. Since the day Father his form did obscureth, I have await'd thee. I bequeath the Lordvessel to thee. And beseech thee. Succeed Lord Gwyn, and inheriteth the Fire of our world. Thou shall endeth this eternal twilight, and avert further Undead sacrifices."
"Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight",Greetings,O chosen Undead. Thou hath journey'd far.
"Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight",Talk ×1,"Since the day Father his form did obscureth, I have await'd thee. Once living, now Undead, and a fitting heir to father Gwyn thou art, and beseech thee succeed Lord Gwyn, and inheriteth the Fire of our world. A grave and arduous test of mettle, yea, it shall be. Indeed, we had felt the warmth of Fire, its radiance, and the life it sustaineth. Without Fire, all shall be a frigid and frightful Dark."
"Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight",Talk ×2,"Please. Father's role thou should assume, and inheriteth the Fire of our world. Thou shall endeth this eternal twilight, and avert further Undead sacrifices. Kingseeker Frampt, the primordial serpent, shall guide thee."
"Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight",Farewell,"Now thou shalt go forth, chosen Undead. May thou be one with the sunlight for evermore."
"Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight",Joining her covenant,"Hereafter, I, Gwynevere, shall serveth as thine guardian. If thou so needest, I shalt devote all to thine safety. May thou be one with the sunlight for evermore."
"Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight",After satiating the Lordvessel,"Magnificent... Thou hast filled the Lordvessel. Indeed, a worthy successor, thou shalt be. My patience was not for nil... I beg of thee. Succeed Lord Gwyn, and inheriteth the world's Fire. We have only thee."
"Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight",Killing her,Aieegh...
Hawkeye Gough,Introduction,"Hm? A visitor, have we? Thou must be the one who freed Artorias. An old friend he was, and thanks to thee... He left this world with honour intact... And here I am, retired and blind. Of little help to thee, I am afraid."
Hawkeye Gough,Talk x1,"If thou seeketh to explore this domain, be wary of a black dragon. I fear thee no match for this terrible beast."
Hawkeye Gough,Talk x2,"Me? There is very little to be said. What is a dog, with no hares to hunt? ...I am lucky to be alive, I suppose."
Hawkeye Gough,Talk x3,"I suspect thou hast taken a gander at it, but the Dark of the Abyss, which swallowed poor Artorias, threatens to devour our entire land of Oolacile. It seems that this dire fate is unavoidable. But, seduced by a Dark serpent or no, they awoke that thing themselves, and drove it mad... One's demise is always one's own making."
Hawkeye Gough,Talk x4,"If thine wish is to succeed poor Artorias, and challenge the spread of the Dark, then thou must face Manus, Father of the Abyss. The Dark emanates from Manus himself. Even if this land shall expire, thou may be able to prevent further corrosion... But even so, one day the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain. And even a legend such as thineself can do nothing to stop that."
Hawkeye Gough,Talk x5,"Now, do not mistake my words. I cherish my work. Wood carving is a nuanced art. I would have much to talk about with that blacksmith. In truth, how is the old chap, I wonder? Still hammering away, I should hope."
Hawkeye Gough,Greetings x1,"Well, thou hast come again. This is a surprise."
Hawkeye Gough,Greetings x2,"Well, thou com'st again. Thou art a strange one."
Hawkeye Gough,Greetings after meeting Kalameet in the gorge,Good morrow... Is the Black Dragon causing thee duress?
Hawkeye Gough,Answering Yes,"Yes, I thought as much. He is called Kalameet. A ferocious dragon indeed, even mighty Anor Londo dared not provoke his ire. I see little good coming from this, but... Thy intent is to persevere... to the bitter end, hmm?"
Hawkeye Gough,Answering Yes,"Hah hah hah! Good, good. What is bravery, without a dash of recklessness! I have taken a liking to thee. And I owe thee much for thy service to Artorias. Now watch, and see how Gough hunts dragons. (Gough will now shoot Kalameet out of the sky)"
Hawkeye Gough,Answering No,A wise choice. Why foist thyself into the fiery maw?
Hawkeye Gough,Talk after answering No,...Art thou prepared to challenge great Kalameet?
Hawkeye Gough,Answering No,"Yes, surely that is best."
Hawkeye Gough,Answering No to original question,...Strange. I am rarely wrong on such matters...
Hawkeye Gough,Talk after answering No,"The Black Dragon troubles you yet, I see."
Hawkeye Gough,Answering No,"...Hmm, yes, I see. I was mistaken..."
Hawkeye Gough,Greetings after defeating Kalameet with your own Greatbow (never shot down),I see that thou has dusted the great black dragon Kalameet. Wondorously played. Lord Gwyn's blessing upon thee. I see that there is at least one legend among ye humans. Dear me... That old bat will never fly again.
Hawkeye Gough,Greetings after defeating Kalameet with Gough's help,Why...Thou has defeated Kalameet? Wondorously played. Lord Gwyn's blessing upon thee. That beast will never take to the skies again.
Hawkeye Gough,Farewell,"Farewell, human. Lead thy life as thou seest fit."
Hawkeye Gough,Attacking him,"Ahh, so this is true human nature. Artorias is in your debt, but thou leavest me little choice... May you perish, for the good of all!"
Hawkeye Gough,Killing Him,Humans...hmph...
Ingward,Introduction (with Lordvessel),"Well, this is a surprise. I get few visitors, save for ghosts. You have... the Lordvessel. Very impressive. I know exactly what your intentions are. You seek the Four Kings whom I guard over. This is the key to the seal. The Four Kings slumber in the deepest chamber of the ruins. Use this key to break the seal and open the floodgates. ...Oh and do not forget... The Darkwraiths reside in a dark void called the Abyss. But the Abyss is no place for ordinary mortals. Although long ago, the knight Artorias traversed the Abyss. If you can find him, and learn from him, the Abyss may prove surmountable."
Ingward,Introduction (without Lordvessel),"Well, this is a surprise. I get few visitors, except for ghosts. Do you have some business here? My name is Ingward. I'm an old man, bound to these parts. But I don't mind a chat. I may even be of some help."
Ingward,Greetings x1,Hello there. What is it? The key to the seal is now in your hands. I will help you in any way possible.
Ingward,Greetings after defeating the Four Kings,"...Magnificent. You defeated the Four Kings. Impressive, even for a bearer of the Lordvessel. And with this, my purpose is exhausted. I have not seen the sun for a long time. Perhaps I could do with a change..."
Ingward,Greetings x2,Hello again. How are you?
Ingward,Greetings x3,"Hello, there. Where have you been? I'm glad to see you well. How can I be of assistance."
Ingward,Talk x1,"New Londo was sacrificed to contain the Darkwraiths. Mark my words. The Darkwraiths are the enemies of man, and any living thing that has a soul. They were never meant to roam again."
Ingward,Talk x2,"I am the Guardian of the Seal. I watch over the Four Kings, the masters of the Darkwraiths. The Darkwraiths are the enemies of man, and any living thing that has a soul. They were born in New Londo, and that is where they perished; the entire city was sacrificed to contain them. ...For that is how great a threat they were..."
Ingward,Back at Firelink,"Oh, hello. The sunlight made me wince, and now I've come back to this dark hole! So what brings you here? I will help you in any way I can."
Ingward,Greetings at Firelink,"Oh, hello. What is it? I will help you in any way that I can."
Ingward,Attacking him,"Sigh... You are no different from the rest... So be it! I am Ingward, the guardian of the seal. Prepare to meet your doom!"
Ingward,Killing him,Ohh...ogghh...How could I allow this...Forgive me...my countrymen...
Kingseeker Frampt,Snoring,Hmgg... Hmgg...
Kingseeker Frampt,Introduction,"Ahh, hello. Was it you who rang the Bell of Awakening? I am the primordial serpent, Kingseeker Frampt, close friend of the Great Lord Gwyn. Chosen Undead, who has rung the Bell of Awakening. I wish to elucidate your fate. Do you seek such enlightenment?"
Kingseeker Frampt,Introduction with Lordvessel,"Ahh, hello. Was it you who rang the Bell of Awakening? I am the Primordial Serpent, Kingseeker Frampt, close friend of the Great Lord Gwyn. Chosen Undead, who has rung the Bell of Awakening. I wish to elucidate your fate, and the very reason your kind have appeared. Chosen Undead, your fate... is to succeed the Great Lord Gwyn. So that you may link the Fire, cast away the Dark, and undo the curse of the Undead. Now, let us take that vessel on a journey. I assume you are ready. Now, be still!"
Kingseeker Frampt,"Answering ""Yes""","Very well. Then I am pleased to share. Chosen Undead. Your fate... is to succeed the Great Lord Gwyn. So that you may link the Fire, cast away the Dark, and undo the curse of the Undead. To this end, you must visit Anor Londo, and acquire the Lordvessel."
Kingseeker Frampt,Greetings,I am pleased to see you well. Is it something urgent?
Kingseeker Frampt,Talk x1,"Those who seek the Realm of Lords must brave Sen's Fortress, a deadly house of traps. Many have gone before you, but none have returned. Fate has chosen you, but proceed with caution."
Kingseeker Frampt,Farewell,"Farewell. Chosen Undead. I remain here, and await thee."
Kingseeker Frampt,Waking Frampt up,"...Hm? No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Well and wide awake! Do not treat me like an old withering snake."
Kingseeker Frampt,Retrieving the Lordvessel,"Heavens! You have done it! You have retrieved the Lordvessel! After a thousand years! It is you, it is really you! Hraaaoogggh! ... Forgive me. I really should calm down. Now, let us take that vessel on a journey. I assume you are ready. Now, be still!"
Kingseeker Frampt,Bringing the player to Firelink Altar,"This is the Firelink Chamber, for the successor of Lord Gwyn. Now, place the Lordvessel on the altar."
Kingseeker Frampt,Speaking before placing Lordvessel,What is it? Place the Lordvessel on the altar. No reason for pause at this point.
Kingseeker Frampt,After placing Lordvessel,"Very well. As Kingseeker, I shall now instruct you, the Lord's successor, in your next task. To achieve your fate, fill the vessel with powerful souls, commensurate to the great soul of Gwyn. Scarce few possess such brilliant souls. Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith, the Four Kings of New Londo, who inherited the shards of Gwyn's soul... and Lord Gwyn's former confidant, Seath the Scaleless. All of their souls are required to satiate the Lordvessel. ... Are you ready? Then we shall return. Stay still for a moment!"
Kingseeker Frampt,Satiating the Lordvessel,"Ahh...ohh! The Lordvessel is satiated... Magnificent... You are the righteous successor to Gwyn, the new Great Lord. And I am Kingseeker no more... Your acquaintance was an honour. I must admit, I am fond of you humans. May you enjoy your serendipity. And may the Age of Fire perpetuate."
Kingseeker Frampt,"Attacking him, jumping down without him, or giving Lordvessel to Kaathe","You sorry fool... You could not be the Chosen one. Enough... I shall slumber, until I am awakened again..."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Greeting,"Oh? Still human, are you? Then I am in luck. Could you help me? As you can see I am stuck, without recourse."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talking before freeing,"Please, I have duties to fulfill, and I will reward you handsomely. Well? I am certain you stand to benefit."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Freeing him,"Thank you, yes, sincerely. I am Knight Lautrec of Carim. I truly appreciate this, and I guarantee a reward, only later."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talk after freeing him,"Yes, very sorry, your reward will have to wait. I have just been freed. Allow me some time."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talk after freeing him x2,I am free. Now I can get back to work... Keh heh heh heh...
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Greeting at Firelink Shrine,"Ahh, hello there. I have your reward. Please accept it. I am grateful to you for freeing me... Keh heh heh heh... Not enough for you? Well, let's not be greedy now... Keh heh heh heh..."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Greeting at Firelink Shrine (if he wasn't freed by the player),Hello... I don't think we've met. I am Knight Lautrec of Carim. We are both Undead. Perhaps we can help one another. Keh heh heh heh...
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talk (if variation mentioned above is done),"Hmm, what business do you have? If you have none, then stay silent."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talk,"Hm, you again? What is it? Our futures are murky. Let's not be too friendly, now."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talk (after Petrus departs with Reah and the clerics),"Ahh, you certainly are keeping busy. Care to pay for a useful tip?"
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Answer 'Yes',"A wise choice, indeed. Maiden Thorolund and her followers recently arrived in this land, but she became stranded deep below the Catacombs. Her followers either fled, or were reduced to Hollows... Leaving Maiden Thorolund all alone. Not a bad tip, huh? A nubile cleric would be replete with Humanity..."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Answer 'No',"Oh, really? Well, suit yourself. Only trying to help."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talk (after receiving the tip),"Hm? That tip I gave you? Ahh, I heard it from a fleeing old man. That poor bastard! All his robes and trinkets won't help him now! Kwah hah hah hah hah!"
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talk (while being hollow),"By the lords... Your face... Hmmm... Your humanity is really slipping. But there are methods. Most fools have more Humanity than they know what to do with. Now, who do you imagine will make the best use of it, hmm?"
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talk 2x,"Well, where have you been? I am glad to see you are safe."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talk 3x,"Have you heard of Trusty Patches? If ever a man has rubbed me up the wrong way, ugh! If he ever comes around again, I swear, I'll have his hide."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Talk 4x,"Oh, hello. I'm considering a change of location... I have a rather, pressing matter to attend to up above. That Keeper has served me well, but... Enough with her... Keh heh heh heh..."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Fighting him at Anor Londo,"Well, look at you. I thought you were wiser, but I thought wrong! Tis a terrible pity. Like a moth flittering towards a flame. You fellows? No? Don't you agree?"
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Fighting him at Anor Londo (if the player is killed at the first try),"So, here we go again! How many times will these lambs rush to slaughter? Well, let's get it over with."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Attacking him (while he's still docile),"Well, what have we here?"
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Attacking him 2x (while he's still docile),Keh heh heh. Are you sure about this?
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Attacking him and making him hostile,"You leave me no choice. But if this is our fate, so be it!"
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Attacking him and making him hostile (if the player has helped him in Undead Parish),"You leave me no choice. I was once grateful to you, But if this is our fate, so be it! You despicable..."
Knight Lautrec of Carim,Killing him,...Curses... How could I...
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Before Freeing him,"… You!… Yes, you!… Here, over here! … Please… … You must help me…"
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,"Returning to him, without freeing him","… Oh, there you are… … You must help me… … Or else… ... She'll have me for lunch! … You're my only hope… … Oh, please…"
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,After freeing him,"… Th-thank you. I would have been her supper without you. Being eaten alive! I shudder to think… Thank you, thank you dearly. I am Laurentius, of the Great Swamp. I will not forget my debt to you."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,"Talking to him, after freeing him.","Oh, hello there. I'm fine, thanks to you."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,First encounter in Firelink Shrine,"Well, I see you made it out! Yeah, I made it out safely, too. I have my Pyromancy of the Great Swamp, so I can usually manage, with a bit of care. Oh, yeah, by the way, er, I can share my spell with you. I think you have a knack for it. All you need are the materials. I'd be please to help you. … Ah, unless you find the magics unsavoury?"
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Responding 'Yes' to his question,"Oh, really… Well, that's a shame. But it is your choice. I'm on the fringe; yeah, I know. Undead or not, that's who I am. I only wish that I could have repaid you somehow."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Responding 'No' to his question,"Yeah, wonderful! I'm sure they'll be of some use, some assistance. Why, let's get started right now."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Responding 'No' without having a pyromancy flame,"Yeah, wonderful! I'm sure they'll be of some use, some assistance. Here first take this, a flame from the Great Swamp, now you're a fully fledged pyromancer. Why, let's get started right now."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Second teaching opportunity,"Oh, hello, there. I am pleased to see you safe. Oh, and er…if by chance you've had a change of heart, I'll be pleased to assist you by sharing my spells."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Talk x1,"Pyromancy is the art of casting fire. Produce flame, then channel it; just as our ancestors did. A pyromancer must be in tune with nature herself. My home, the Great Swamp, is an abundant store of nature. You will understand, one day; it only takes time."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Talk x2,"Pyromancy has a, well, rather primitive aspect to it. It meshes poorly with advanced culture, and pyromancers are considered rather unsavoury. Which is fine, as I never got along with anybody anyway. So, for me, turning Undead didn't change a thing! Hah hah hah hah."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Talk x3 (if a pyromancer),A pyromancer's flame is a part of his own body. The flame develops right along with his skill. … Sorry. You're a pyromancer yourself. You already know this.
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Talk x3 (any other class),"A pyromancer's flame is a part of his own body. The flame develops right along with his skill. … When I gave you that flame, I gave you a part of myself. Please take good care of it."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Talk x4,"My teacher, whom I imagine still resides in the Great Swamp, had a funny way of putting it. He said that ""Pyromancy is the ultimate fantasy…"" ""We are born into Dark, and warmed by Fire, but this Fire we cannot touch."" ""Those whose fascination with Fire persists, learn to hold it in their own hand."" He rather had a way with words, the old withering frog!"
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Talk x5,"In this land, pyromancers earn a certain respect. The Witch of Izalith, one of the legendary Lords, is the godmother of pyromancy. So, the day I became Undead, I was ecstatic. I felt as if I'd been chosen to attune myself to the ancient arts. ...Of course, it wasn't all that romantic in the end…"
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Greeting,"Oh, hello, there. I am pleased to see you safe. As always, if you provide the materials, I can teach you pyromancy."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Leaving abruptly,"Wait, friend! Where are you off to?"
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,"Returning, after leaving abruptly",That was rather abrupt. You are an odd one. Hah hah hah hah.
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Leaving,"Good bye then. Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go Hollow."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,"Leaving, after making a purchase",Good bye then. Come back if you find anything new.
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,"In possession of ""amazing pyromancy""[note 1]","Ah, hello, there. You've been a stranger these days. Why, what spectacular pyromancy. Tell me about it. I have never seen anything like it."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Responding 'Yes' to his question about your pyromancy,"Why, yes, of course! Thank you for sharing. I'm still an able pyromancer. I shall locate her myself. I am in your debt, once again."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,Responding 'No' to his question about your pyromancy,"... I see. I suppose I was mistaken. In any case, I definitely trust you. Apologies, my friend. Forget that I said anything."
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,When attacked,"• Curse the heavens! Are you mad!I owe my life to you!This is wrong! You were my friend!• You detest my pyromancy! That must be it!Then, I'll give you a taste of it!And it will not be pleasant, I assure you!"
Laurentius of the Great Swamp,When killed:,Curses...
Lord's Blade Ciaran,Introduction,"...You, is that not... The soul of the man who fell on this spot, he was a dear friend. I wish to pay proper respect, with that Soul. Would you be willing to part with it?"
Lord's Blade Ciaran,"Answering ""Yes""","Thank you, you are very kind. Please take this, I no longer need it. May the Lord guide thee."
Lord's Blade Ciaran,"Answering ""No""","Yes, of course... I must not be presumptuous, Artorias would not have approved."
Lord's Blade Ciaran,"Talk after answering ""No""",What is it? Something else? Have you changed your mind?
Lord's Blade Ciaran,"Answering ""No"" again",...Then you have no business with me...
Lord's Blade Ciaran,Talk without possessing the Soul of Artorias,...Are you human? ...I forgive you. I'm here to pay respects to a dear friend. Please allow me a moment alone.
Lord's Blade Ciaran,Attacking her,"Hmph, you humans... Always taking what you please. Then, I shall do the same."
Lord's Blade Ciaran,She kills the player,"Hmph, such conceit... How did you imagine that the Lord's Blade would not reach you?"
Lord's Blade Ciaran,Killing her,"But, how... You humans... *My dear Artorias*"
Marvelous Chester,Introduction,"Hm...Oh, let me guess...Snatched by a shadowy limb, and dragged off to the past?"
Marvelous Chester,"Answering ""Yes""","Yes, of course. Exactly what happened to me. We are both strangers in this strange land. But, at least now there are two of us."
Marvelous Chester,"Answering ""No""","Oh, well, my mistake...But we are both travelers. We ought to help one another out."
Marvelous Chester,Talk,"Did you happen across Knight Artorias? The legendary Abysswalker, from the old tales...Well, if you haven't, it's just as well...He's a colourless sort, if you ask me. Mwah hah hah!"
Marvelous Chester,Talk x2,"So, what did that giant mushroom make you do? Not that I care. It's none of my business. Heh heh heh..."
Marvelous Chester,Talk x3,"Hm? I've little to talk about, really. Oh, you know me. What do I know? Heh heh!"
Marvelous Chester,Leave,So long.
Marvelous Chester,Greeting,"Oh, still alive, are you? Think of anything that you might need?"
Marvelous Chester,Greeting x2,"Oh, for Juniper's sake. Put some spring into your step! Mwah hah hah!"
Marvelous Chester,Talk after defeating Artorias,"Did you really slay Knight Artorias? I'd heard the Abyss found him first, but even still...That's absolutely treacherous. Yes, magnificently so! Mwah hah hah!"
Marvelous Chester,Talk x4,"Believe it or not, Oolacile has brought the Abyss upon itself. Fooled by that toothy serpent, they upturned the grave of primeval man, and incited his ornery wrath. What could they have been thinking? But to you and I, it's all ancient history. You have to ask yourself. Does it really matter? Heh heh heh..."
Marvelous Chester,Greeting after invading the player,"...Oh, you! You have quite some nerve. Or are you just thick? Fine, then. What is it that you need?"
Marvelous Chester,Talk x5,"...Well, you've quite the nerve! I've had enough of you!"
Marvelous Chester,Leave,I'll be seeing you. If you survive your travels...
Marvelous Chester,Greeting (if player is nude),"Oh, you again...What ever's the matter? No, I can tell. You need me more than ever. Mwah hah hah!"
Marvelous Chester,Talk while nude,"What? If you've something to say, then say it! Just don't say the wrong thing...Heh heh heh!"
Marvelous Chester,Leave while nude,So long...We'll be seeing each other...Gee hee hee!
Marvelous Chester,Attacking him,"Oh! It's come to blows, has it? Fine, then. I've had enough of you, anyway!"
Marvelous Chester,Attacking him after invading the player,"What now? You think this is all my fault? How very, very, petty of you! Very petty, indeed!"
Marvelous Chester,Fighting,"There! Ah-hah, there!"
Marvelous Chester,Player getting hit,What? Now you're feeling the heat? You should have thought long and hard...Nyah hah hah hah hah!
Marvelous Chester,Player death,You damn fool. I am Marvelous Chester! What did you expect?
Marvelous Chester,Killing,"Hrrg...You win...please...Oh, please...have mercy..."
"Oscar, Knight of Astora",Greeting,"...Oh, you... You're no Hollow, eh? Thank goodness... I'm done for, I'm afraid... I'll die soon, then lose my sanity... I wish to ask something of you... You and I, we're both Undead... Hear me out, will you?"
"Oscar, Knight of Astora",Answer 'Yes'(NG),"...Regrettably, I have failed in my mission... But perhaps you can keep the torch lit... There is an old saying in my family... Thou who art Undead, art chosen... In thine exodus from the Undead Asylum, maketh pilgrimage to the land of Ancient Lords...

Oswald of Carim,Introduction,"Greetings. I am Oswald of Carim, the pardoner. Thou art a friend. For thee, a warm welcome. Cometh thou to confess? Or to accuse? For indeed all sin is my domain."
Oswald of Carim,Leaving,Thou art welcome anytime. It is only human to commit a sin... Heh heh heh heh...
Oswald of Carim,Greetings x1,"Greetings, and welcome back. I am pleased to see thee preserving thine humanity."
Oswald of Carim,Greetings x2,"Thou appearest to lack faith, but the Gods are magnanimous. If thou desireth to preserve thine humanity, then confess thy misdoings to me. Be it granting absolution or doling penance; all sin is my domain."

Patches,Introduction 1* (In Catacombs or Tomb of the Giants),Good day! You look reasonably sane! What are you doing in the Catacombs? Are you a cleric or something?
Patches,"Answering ""Yes""(In the Catacombs)","Yes, I imagined as much. Best of luck with your pilgrimages or missions or whatever you do. This place is treacherous. Do watch your step, eh? Heh heh heh..."
Patches,"Answering ""Yes""(In Tomb of the Giants)","Yes, I guessed as much. Well, here's a tip. There's a stash of treasure right down that hole. I found it first, but... well, you're the cleric, right? I owe you for all that, er, praying and what not... I'll give you first pick. Well, go on, have a look. It'll shimmer you blind. Heh heh heh..."
Patches,"Answering ""No""(In the Catacombs)","No? Well, that's strange. Ohhh, I know what it is. You've come for the trinkets, haven't you? Well, whatever it is... This place is treacherous. Do watch your step. Heh heh heh..."
Patches,"Answering ""No""(In Tomb of the Giants)","No? Really? Then I have no qualms telling you. There's a fine stash of treasure right down that hole! I found it first, but we're friends now! Go on, take a peak. It'll shimmer you blind! Heh heh heh..."
Patches,Introduction 2**(In the Catacombs),"Ah, oh! Well, well, how are you, then? I, uh, sort of lost my way, yes... But when I came here I didn't touch any levers, no, not me! Very peculiar, isn't it? Wait, did something happen to you? Hey, don't look at me like that. I'm Trusty Patches, the one-and-only! Here, everything's good with us, eh? Aww, c'mon, take it! (Gives the player 1 Soul of a Lost Undead)Heh heh. We'll be wonderful friends. Heh heh heh..."
Patches,Speaking again after Introduction 2,"Oh, does it really matter that much? C'mon, now. What exactly do you think I did? You're not making sense, my friend. Heh heh heh..."
Patches,After Patches flips the bridge with the player on it,"Ah, oh! Well, how are you, then? ...I slipped and flipped that lever, you see... ...It didn't cause you any trouble, by chance?"
Patches,"Answering ""Yes""",(He will give the player 1 Humanity)
Patches,"Answering ""No""","Oh, really? Yes, I see... Righty-oh! Then everything's good, isn't it? I'm Trusty Patches, the one-and-only! You and I, just a couple of Undead Outcasts, right mate? Heh heh heh..."
Patches,Greetings in Tomb of the Giants if met in the Catacombs,"What, you again? Well, well! You've been a stranger. Ah good to see you're well, mate. Oh, right, you came at the perfect time. There's a fine stash of treasure right down that hole. I found it first, but... well, we're friends now. I'll split it with you! In any case, have a look, it'll shimmer you blind! Heh heh heh..."
Patches,Speaking to him before looking down the hole,"There, that hole. Take a closer look."
Patches,"Kicking the player down the hole(If answered ""No"" to being a cleric)","Heh heh, this is what I do, my friend. The trinkets I'll be stripping off your corpse; that's the real treasure! Nyah hah hah hah!"
Patches,"Kicking the player down the hole(If answered ""Yes"" to being a cleric)","Heh heh, you got what you deserve! You damn clerics, you're worse than maggots! You must be loaded! I'll strip your corpse clean! Nyah hah hah hah!"
Patches,"Speaking to him after returning from the hole(If answered ""Yes"" to being a cleric)","Blimey, how did you... You weren't supposed to survive that... Well, no matter. I'll settle this once and for all. You lousy self-righteous cleric!"
Patches,"Killing the player(If answered ""Yes"" to being a cleric)","Phew... The righteous prevail, again... Hey, don't blame me, mate."
Patches,"Speaking to him after returning from the hole(If answered ""No"" to being a cleric)","...Oh, you, I... Well, let's just calm down. Talk about things... I did you wrong. But, I didn't mean it. These...temptations, they can, well, overcome me... You know what I mean? Don't you? Please forgive me. You and me, we're jolly Undead outcasts, aren't we?"
Patches,"Answering ""Yes""","Oh, brilliant! A second chance! Wonderful! I had a feeling you'd understand, I did! But if I were in your shoes... Ooh! Who know what I'd have done? But now... We're friends again, eh? Heh heh heh..."
Patches,"Answering ""No""","Oh for heaven's sake, let's not mope about, eh? You're still alive, I've said I'm sorry! Wait, I know! Here, take this. It proves something, doesn't it? (He will give the player 1 Twin Humanities)"
Patches,Speaking to him before he goes to Firelink,"I did you wrong. But, I didn't mean it. These...temptations, they can overcome me... You know what I mean? Don't you? Please, forgive me."
Patches,Finding him at Firelink,"Oh, we meet again. How many of you are there? You've come at the perfect time. I'm done with the looting. I'm a humble merchant now! And wondrous treasure, have I! At a special price for you. There you are, have a nice look at them. Oh relax, no more funny business out of me, my friend!"
Patches,Talk x1,"Oi, have you met Petrus, that self-proclaimed cleric? Believe me this one, bruv†... The man is scum. Don't you be fooled by his claims to do good. They're all the same, those rotten clerics."
Patches,Talk x2,"Oi, have you met Lautrec the Embraced? Believe me on this one, bruv†...He's completely mad. He wouldn't think twice about cutting somebody down. So watch out for him, especially if you've humanity to spare."
Patches,Talk x3,"Here, have you met that sunbathing Solaire? Believe me on this one, bruv†...He's a complete idiot. But he happens to be an awfully strong idiot. Just nod your head and keep him on your side! Nyah hah hah hah!"
Patches,Talk x4,"Here, have you met that backwood Shiva? Believe me on this one, bruv†...The man is trouble. I can see it in his eyes. I just can. Hmph, no doubt about it. Watch him."
Patches,Greetings x1 as a merchant,"Oh, there you are again. Welcome to Trust Patches' Trove of Treasures. We chop prices, not limbs!"
Patches,Greetings x2 as a merchant,"Oh, you again. Fancy that. You've come at the perfect time. Some new gems have come my way. I saved them specially, just for you, mate."
Patches,Leaving after making a purchase,"Right, good stuff, eh? Don't you forget who got it for you! Heh heh heh..."
Patches,Leaving without making a purchase,"Come on, you can do better than that. Nobody likes a tightwad, you hear me?"
Patches,Attacking him,"Curses, what's wrong with you! Well, if that's what it has to be! Why you..."
Patches,Killing the player,"What happened to you? Curses, you left me no choice..."
Patches,Killing him,Curses! How in the... What did I do? What... did... I... do?!
Petrus of Thorolund,Introduction,"Hello there. I believe we are not acquainted? I am Petrus of Thorolund. Have you business with us? ...If not, I'd prefer to keep a distance, if possible."
Petrus of Thorolund,Speaking to him again,"Hello there. I realize that I have requested that we retain our distance, but I also want you to know that it is not meant in ill-will. Here, take this. As a token of peace. No, go ahead. It's for you. (Petrus will give the player a Copper Coin.)"
Petrus of Thorolund,Speaking to him a 3rd time,"Oh, my... you again? Oh, I know. How about this... I have to await my companions here anyway, so, what if I were to teach you some miracles? Would that please you?"
Petrus of Thorolund,"Answering ""Yes""","Very well. Then first, a Covenant with the Gods."
Petrus of Thorolund,"Answering ""No""",That is a shame. But each to their own. Speak to me if you have a change of heart.
Petrus of Thorolund,Joining covenant,"Now, let me share my Miracles. Only, their ultimate effectiveness will be determined by your efforts, and your faith."
Petrus of Thorolund,Not joining covenant,That is a shame. But each to their own. Speak to me if you have a change of heart.
Petrus of Thorolund,Talk x1,"My companions are M'lady and her young knights. She is young, but burdened by an Undead mission. We are her defenses, to keep her from harm."
Petrus of Thorolund,Talk x2,"An Undead mission? Regrettably, I cannot share that with you. But you are my pupil, perhaps if you show your faith...(Petrus will now request souls for information.)"
Petrus of Thorolund,Giving him the souls,"Very well. I can surely tell you, of all people... Undead clerics are given a mission to seek Kindling. Kindling is the art of feeding bonfires with humanity. Through Kindling, we shall one day be granted magnificent powers."
Petrus of Thorolund,Refusing him the souls,I am afraid that may be difficult. For our missions are sacred.
Petrus of Thorolund,Leaving,Come again. The effectiveness of the teachings depend upon your faith.
Petrus of Thorolund,Greetings,"Oh, hello. I will teach you Miracles. A promise is a promise, after all."
Petrus of Thorolund,Greetings after his guests arrive,"Oh, hello. My guests have finally arrived. I will be departing with them shortly. So, I'm afraid I will be saying good-bye soon. It was a pleasure."
Petrus of Thorolund,"Talk x3(after Reah, Vince, and Nico arrive)",Reah is the youngest daughter of the good house of Thorolund. Those young knights are her old schoolmates. But I'm not sure what to make of them... I'm afraid they may be a bad influence...
Petrus of Thorolund,"Greetings after Reah, Vince, and Nico leave","Uh, oh, you again? Me? Er, I've become separated from M'lady. I've scoured near and far, but no sight of her... Where could she have gone? M'lady... To think I swore to protect you with my life... (Petrus will not teach Miracles until speaking to him 2 more times)"
Petrus of Thorolund,Speaking with him again,"Your Highness... where have you gone? I am entirely to blame for this... Oh woe is me. I am unworthy, deathly so..."
Petrus of Thorolund,Speaking with him a 3rd time,"Oh, I'm sorry. Miracles, was it? ...Sometimes I lose myself; pay me no mind!"
Petrus of Thorolund,Greetings after Reah is rescued in Tomb of the Giants,"Ah, oh, you. Have you seen M'lady? Oh, blast, where might she be, and would she be safe..."
Petrus of Thorolund,Greetings after buying information from Lautrec,"Oh, hello there. Have you spoken with Sir Lautrec? Splendid. In the depths of the Catacombs, M'lady slipped off the giant's coffin and into a hole. Her two companions are no longer human; and the lass weeps in solitude. Right now, you could do as you please with her. The poor little purebred is entirely helpless. Keh heh heh heh..."
Petrus of Thorolund,Greetings after speaking to Reah in Undead Parish,"...Oh it's you... ...You rescued M'lady? Well, a pity that is, for it will amount to nothing. For the little madam is not worth her salt without her family name. Keh heh heh heh......"
Petrus of Thorolund,Attacking him,"By the Lords! You damn fool! Enough of you, feel the wrath of the Gods!"
Petrus of Thorolund,Being killed by him,"Fool...What were you thinking? Too bad for you, I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing. Best of luck as a Hollow! Gah hah hah hah hah!"
Petrus of Thorolund,Killing Him,N... no... this can't be... It can't end like this...
Quelana of Izalith,First meeting,"Hmm... A mere Undead, yet you can see me? Fascinating... I am Quelana of Izalith. I am not often revealed to walkers of flesh. You have a gift. Are you, too, one who seeks my pyromancy? Like Salaman?"
Quelana of Izalith,Answering 'Yes',"Yes, of course. It should be expected. Very well. You shall be my pupil. But to pursue my pyromancy, you must give something up. Are you prepared to do this?"
Quelana of Izalith,Answering 'No',What? Considering my pyromancy?
Quelana of Izalith,Answering 'No' again,"Hmm, very well. Then we are done. You have spoken. Now away with you."
Quelana of Izalith,Talk 1x,"Long ago, I accepted another pupil, like yourself. Over two-hundred years ago there was a man, almost as bungling as you... In your world he was called Salaman the Master Pyromancer. The little rascal really made something of himself."
Quelana of Izalith,Talk x2,"Pyromancy is the art of invoking and manipulating fire. But remember one thing. Always fear the flame, lest you be devoured by it, and lose yourself. I would hate to see that happen again..."
Quelana of Izalith,Farewell,"Now, go. Whatever you do, do not crack and go Hollow. Lest my time spent on you be wasted."
Quelana of Izalith,Greeting,"Ah, there you are. I was expecting you. Let us begin."
Quelana of Izalith,Farewell without buying a pyromancy,"No luck, hm... Well young pupil, you must have patience. But do not keep me waiting much longer."
Quelana of Izalith,Greeting x2,"Ah, you again. I applaud your diligence."
Quelana of Izalith,Greeting after leaving Blighttown,"Ah, it has been some time. Truth be told, I thought you had perished."
Quelana of Izalith,Talk x3,"The Witch of Izalith? Please do not speak of her. I abandoned my mother and sisters and fled to this land. Now I roam these parts, feigning ablution, and pretending to seek answers."
Quelana of Izalith,Talk x4,"Hmm... I have a favour to ask... My mother, The Witch of Izalith, was one of the primeval Lords... Her power came from the soul that she found near the First Flame....She focused this power to light a flame of her own, but she failed to control it. The Flame of Chaos engulfed Mother and my sisters, and moulded them into deformed creatures. Only I escaped, and now I am here. But my mother and sisters have been in anguish since. I beseech you. Free Mother and my sisters from the Flame of Chaos. I cannot do it myself; I lack the strength, and the bravery... But you... I realize what I am asking. But please, free their poor souls... Mother's ambitions were misguided, no doubt, but surely a thousand years of atonement is enough!"
Quelana of Izalith,After killing the Bed of Chaos,"Outstanding... You have done very well. Thank you, I am blessed to have met you. I suppose I can call you fool no longer. I can hardly thank you enough. Please take this... It is all of me."
Quelana of Izalith,Talk after killing the Bed of Chaos,"Ah, very well. There is nothing left for me to teach you. Our time together is done. It was short, but sweet."
Quelana of Izalith,Talk after killing the Bed of Chaos x2,Fool. Hurry along. I can do nothing more for you.
Quelana of Izalith,Leaving without buying a Pyromancy after killing the Bed of Chaos,"No luck, hmm... Do not let it bother you."
Quelana of Izalith,Attacking,Hmm... The voice of reason fails? Then here is a lesson for you... That you can only learn once!
Quelana of Izalith,Killing,"Farewell, my mother, my sisters... What have you done..."
Reah of Thorolund,Introduction,"You are Undead, as well? Then we've no time to fraternize. I have my mission, and you no doubt have yours. We must not let this curse overcome us."
Reah of Thorolund,Speaking with her at Firelink,Did I not explain the urgency of our tasks? Who are you so uncouth as to lack such judgement? By the looks of you...I should think not.
Reah of Thorolund,Finding her in Tomb of the Giants,"You're no Hollow, are you? Thank goodness. Please be careful. There are two fierce Hollows not far from here. They were once brave knights... my former escorts. Who would let such strong spirits be Hollowed so? Heavens... Is there nothing... Nothing at all to be done."
Reah of Thorolund,Speaking to her after killing Hollowed Vince and Nico,"You banished those two Hollows did you? It pains me to think of the trouble my failings have caused. I am certain both Vince and Nico are grateful to you. Thank you so very much. Here, these belonged to them. You deserve them more than I."
Reah of Thorolund,Speaking to her in Undead Parish,"Hello... I will never forget what you did. I am deeply indebted, for it was not within my power to save Vince or Nico. I cannot thank you enough. In case you have not heard, I am Reah of Thorolund. I only wish there were some way I could help you, but I am inexperienced, and I only know the art of Miracles. If that could be of any help, speak to me again."
Reah of Thorolund,Speaking to her again,"Would a Miracle be of any help to you? I would be most pleased if that were so. May we discuss Miracles, then?"
Reah of Thorolund,Talk x1,"Vince and Nico were fooled by a lout named Patches, and turned into Hollows. My prayers did them no good. It is my ignorance, my frailty that has sealed their fates. Perhaps Petrus realized my weakness all along, and thus made the decision to abandon me. I can hardly blame him now."
Reah of Thorolund,Talk x2,"I do not warm easily to unfamiliar faces. The bonfire below is so frequented, it makes it difficult... I have lost all those who were close to me."
Reah of Thorolund,Greetings,"I was wondering when you might return. It is a great relief to see you. Now, let us speak of Miracles."
Reah of Thorolund,Farewell,"Then, be safe. Farewell. Vereor Nox."
Reah of Thorolund,Attacking her,"Ow! Horrors! The nerve! Are you a heretic, or just plain Hollow? It matters not, for you shall not escape! You will offend the Gods no longer!"
Reah of Thorolund,Killing her,Hrgkt! Eeg... Father...
Rickert of Vinheim,Introduction,"Hrm? Well, this is unusual. You haven't lost your head. And more importantly you're free. How on Earth... ...Well, I shouldn't pry. I am Rickert of Vinheim. I was once an established smith, but look at me now. Can you believe it?"
Rickert of Vinheim,Speaking with him again,"Hm? What is it? Have you...Oh, no, don't worry. I've no intention of escape. It's safe here. I can't bear the thought of going Hollow out there. Although, I must admit, I've not much to occupy myself. How about this? I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather minimal tools. I will show you what made me the best in Vinheim."
Rickert of Vinheim,Talk ×1,"Hm? What is it? There's nothing to talk about. We're both cursed; Undead. But what's there, really, to moan about?"
Rickert of Vinheim,Talk ×2,"Old Big Hat? Of course I've heard of him. Who hasn't in Vinheim? He was a royal member of Dragon School, until he turned Undead. I hear he was quite the character...Only, that was a hundred years ago. What interest have you in the old eccentric now?"
Rickert of Vinheim,Talk ×3,"Sorcery? Don't ask me how it actually works. We only fiddle and forge, until it works itself in. That's how we do it in Vinheim, at least. We prefer to leave the theorizing to those uppity scholars."
Rickert of Vinheim,Farewell without purchase,Come back soon. Smithing helps soothe my nerves. Don't let me wither away out of idleness!
Rickert of Vinheim,Farewell after making a purchase,"Good-bye, then. Keep your head on, out there. You really help break the monotony."
Rickert of Vinheim,Bringing him an ember he can't use,"Hey, hang on... Is that an ember? Oh, no, I'm sorry. We of Vinheim don't deal in shoddy embers like that. Perhaps you should try an old smith out in the country."
Rickert of Vinheim,Greetings,"Oh, hello. What weapons have you brought? Go on; show me."
Rickert of Vinheim,Bringing him Large Magic Ember,"Hey, hang on... That's a sorcery ember...isn't it? Yes, it certainly is... The first I've seen since my banishment from Vinheim. What do you say, friend? Mind giving that to me? This is no-man's land. I'm the only one who could handle it anyway."
Rickert of Vinheim,Giving him the ember,"Yes, as you should! I won't disappoint you. I'm taskless no longer!"
Rickert of Vinheim,Refusing him the ember,"...Yes, I see. All right, fine. But I don't think you're really seeing things clearly."
Rickert of Vinheim,Bringing him Enchanted Ember,"Hey, hang on... Is that...a sorcery ember? I've never seen one like that, not even back in Vinheim. What a brilliant flame! Please, friend, let me have that. I am begging you. I am a craftsman of Vinheim. I'd go Hollow before I pass up a flame like that!"
Rickert of Vinheim,Giving him the ember,"Oh, really! You are wonderful! I will forge a Rickert masterpiece, just for you! A weapon to make a legend out of you..."
Rickert of Vinheim,Refusing him the ember,"...Fine. ...Fine, I won't bother you. It was wonderful if only to gaze upon. It takes me back to old times."
Rickert of Vinheim,Leaving abruptly,Hm? What's happened?
Rickert of Vinheim,Returning after leaving abruptly,"What was that about? Ahh, it doesn't matter."
Rickert of Vinheim,Attacking him,"What's got into you! Damn, you've gone Hollow, have you? Forget about it! I have nothing more to say. Be gone! Oh, go away! There's nothing here for you. Nothing at all."
Rickert of Vinheim,Killing him,No...impossible... Why didn't I see? ...You've gone Hollow...
Shiva of the East,Introduction,"I've heard all about you. I'm Shiva of the East, captain of the brigade. Let's teach you the clan basics now, as there is no time to chat in the midst of fighting. Except there's little in the form of rules, you hear? Fight and hunt as you like. Whoever's fastest gets the prey. That's the way we do it. Only... Don't forget what Alvina said. Traitors aren't given a second chance, for any reason. That's about it, then. Don't worry, it's a good old time, isn't it? Great to have you with us. Good hunting to you."
Shiva of the East,Speaking to him after speaking with his bodyguard,"Ah, did you notice that one? Sharp eyes! He's one of the clan. From the East, like myself. Always slinking in the shadows, but he's a tough one. You'll see what I mean. Hah hah hah hah!"
Shiva of the East,Speaking to him while in the forest,"Don't worry, now. You'll be called in soon enough. Hunters with patience score the best kills."
Shiva of the East,Speaking to him in Blighttown,"Hello again. Strange to meet away from the clan and the forest. But while you're here, how about some equipment? I love collecting these things, but I can only keep so many. And, you know, you are a friend. I'll sell them cheap."
Shiva of the East,Greetings in Blighttown,"We meet again. I have the equipment, if you have the need."
Shiva of the East,Farewell in Blighttown,I see you have a sharp eye for trinkets. Suits me fine. I'll be seeing you.
Shiva of the East,Attacking him,"Hrg! You have some guts, to turn on us! Have a look at my sword, for it's the last thing you'll see! Hiyaah!"
Shiva of the East,Being killed by him,You sick Hollow... Don't you ever come round again.
Shiva of the East,Killing him,You poor fool... You won't be able to run far enough...
Sieglinde of Catarina,Introduction after being rescued in Duke's Archives,"It was you who rescued me? Why, thank you. I am Sieglinde of Catarina. I don't know how I ended up in that crystal... It wasn't terrible in there, but I could hardly move. I must think of some way to repay you."
Sieglinde of Catarina,Speaking to her again in Duke's Archives,"Oh! Have you seen my father? You wouldn't miss him. A suit of armour, just like mine?"
Sieglinde of Catarina,"Answering ""Yes""","Thank goodness! I knew he was here somewhere. Well then, now I must find him. Thanks again, truly. Now if he'll just stay put, and keep out of trouble."
Sieglinde of Catarina,"Answering ""No""","Yes, I see... But if you should happen to bump into him, tell him that Sieglinde is on her way, and that he ought to just stay put. And again, thank you kindly."
Sieglinde of Catarina,Speaking to her at Firelink,"Oh, hello again. We're both managing quite well, aren't we? But I haven't found my father yet. Have you seen him?"
Sieglinde of Catarina,"Answering ""Yes""",Really! Then I must be off. I'm sorry he's caused you trouble... He has a knack for that. If he'd just stay put...
Sieglinde of Catarina,"Answering ""No""","Yes, I see. Well, I had to ask. I will continue searching a bit longer. Thank you so much."
Sieglinde of Catarina,Speaking at Firelink after saving Siegmeyer in Lost Izalith,"Well, hello again! I have finally located my father. All of your help was invaluable to us...Thank you so much. I was finally able to pass on my mother's last words."
Sieglinde of Catarina,Speaking again,"My father? He went on his final adventure. Don't worry, that's just the way he is. Undead or no. Sort of reassuring, really. If he goes Hollow, I'll just have to kill him again."
Sieglinde of Catarina,Speaking at Ash Lake,"My father...all Hollow now...has been subdued. He will cause no more trouble. It's finally over...I will return to Catarina. You assisted us both greatly. I can hardly return the favour, but please accept this. It's of no use to me now."
Sieglinde of Catarina,Speaking again,"Oh, father...dear father... (Sobbing)"
Sieglinde of Catarina,Attacking her,"What in the...! What the devil?! Yes, now I see. You are one of the bad ones. Then, there's only one thing to do with you."
Sieglinde of Catarina,Being killed by her,Rest assured. I will kill you as many times as it takes.
Sieglinde of Catarina,Killing her,"Oh, how can this be...! ...dear Father..."
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking outside Sen's Fortress,Mmm... Hrmmmmm...
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Introduction outside Sen's Fortress,"Mmm...mmm... Mm! Oh-hoh! Forgive me. I was absorbed in thought. I am Siegmeyer of Catarina. Quite honestly, I have run flat up against a wall. Or, a gate, I should say. The thing just won't budge. No matter how long I wait. And, oh, have I waited! So, here I sit, in quite a pickle. Weighing my options, so to speak! Hah hah hah hah!"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking again outside Sen's Fortress,Still closed... Still closed... Mmm...
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Introduction inside Sen's Fortress,"Mmm...mmm... Mm! Oh-hoh! Forgive me. I was absorbed in thought. I am Siegmeyer of Catarina. Quite honestly, I have run flat up against a wall. ...Or, a ball, to be precise. ...I'm afraid I'm a bit too plump to be outrunning those things. So, here I sit, in quite a pickle. Weighing my options, so to speak! Hah hah hah hah!"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking again inside Sen's Fortress,"Perhaps I could try some rolling... Bah, no chance. My head would spin. Mmm..."
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking inside Sen's Fortress if met outside,"Mmm...mmm... Mm! Oh-hoh! Ahh, where did you come from? Splendid news, I tell you. First, I hear a great roar. And, voila! The path is open. Just goes to show. Good things come to those who wait! Hah hah hah hah!"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking again inside if met outside,"Mm, mmm... Ah, so you see my plight? Yes, indeed, I have run up against a wall.... Or, a ball, to be precise.... I'm afraid I'm a bit too plump to be outrunning those things. So, here I sit, in quite a pickle. But who knows? Perhaps we'll have another development? Hah hah hah hah!"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking in Anor Londo,Mmm... Hrmmmmm... Whatever can be done?
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking again in Anor Londo,"Ah, you again! Let me guess. Were you repelled by the Silver Knights? Aww, don't be ashamed. 'Tis the fate of vanguards like you and I. I'll think of something. We can overcome this together!"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking a third time in Anor Londo,"This is quite a fix... We'll need another three, no, maybe five more bodies... Hmm...Quite a fix indeed..."
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking after defeating all Silver Knights in the next room,"Mmm...mmm... Mm! Oh-hoh! What's on your mind, friend? Wait! ...You defeated those monsters?! Fantastic... I am saved. This knight of Catarina hereby commends you! Take this, as a token of my gratitude. But be warned, gallantry entails great risks. Next time, give me a chance to come up with a plan."
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking at Firelink,"Well! Fancy meeting you here. You did much for me up above. I am grateful. You know, I was thinking... The gates at the old fortress... Was that your doing?"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,"Answering ""Yes""","Yes! I knew it! It seemed like an unlikely coincidence. Well, am I fortunate! This knight of Catarina thanks you sincerely. Please take this, as a token of my gratitude."
Siegmeyer of Catarina,"Answering ""No""","Is that so? Hmm, no matter. Stranger things have happened. Sometimes one only has to give it some time."
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking again at Firelink,There you are. I'll be heading down below shortly. There's nothing worthwhile up above. No worries! Adventuring is my life; I'm prepared for the worst. Hah hah hah hah!
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking in Blighttown,Sng...sng... Zzzzzz...
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking again in Blighttown,"Mm! Oh-hoh! Excuse me. I was absorbed in thought, I just drifted away. You see, I'm actually in a bit of a fix. I've made it this far, but I'm short on antitode moss for the trip back. ...By my knighthood, I am ashamed to ask... But can you spare a few scraps of moss?"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,"Answering ""Yes""","Fantastic! Thank you, a saint you are. This knight of Catarina expresses his deepest gratitude. I shall not forget this. Please, take this; a symbol of my appreciation. Well, our fates do seem entwined, don't they? Perhaps this, too, is the will of Lord Gwyn! Hah hah hah hah!"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,"Answering ""No""","Yes, I see... No need to worry! I'll be fine. I can make it without that silly moss. Think about it. Have I ever let a little hardship slow me down? Hah hah hah hah!"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,"Speaking again if answered ""No""","Mmm... Mm! Oh-hoh! What's on your mind, friend? You've brought moss, perchance?"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking a third time in Blighttown,The Poison Swamp... It's like quicksand in there... Mmm...
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking in Lost Izalith,Sng...sng... Zzzzzz...
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking again in Lost Izalith,"Mm! Oh-hoh! Excuse me. I was so absorbed in thought, I just drifted away. It must be the warmth. Well, what's on your mind? No, don't tell me. Those monsters making life difficult for you? You need not be ashamed. We are in the same boat. ...You know, I really have run up quite a debt to you. ...Perhaps the time has come... ..."
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking if the player kills all the Chaos Eaters before Siegmeyer can fight,"...Oh, there you are. Wait! ...Did you defeat those dire creatures? Outstanding... You never fail to impress. Well, wonderful. This knight of Catarina thanks you. Take this, as a token of my gratitude. I feel like I'm always thanking you... I curse my own inability."
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking a third time in Lost Izalith,"...Friend, I have an idea. A good one, really. ...I will rush those dire fiends, and you can slip away in the confusion. Please, friend, I owe you much more than this. By the honour of the knights of Catarina, allow me to assist you. And now, I go! Don't be slow!"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Screams as he fights the Chaos Eaters,"Hrgrraaaaggh! Hiyaaaaaah! C'mon! Over here, you fiends! Perish, foul creatures! I am Siegmeyer of Catarina, and you shall feel my wrath!"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Speaking if Siegmeyer survives the Chaos Eater fight,"Hng...hng... Why, you! Didn't you get away? Well, you've saved me, once again... Thank goodness... I'm exhausted... I think I'll have a rest. Don't you worry, the ground below me is my pillow. I'll recover shortly..."
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Attacking him,"Yeeg! Whoa! Wha! Why, are you...! That's your game, is it? Well, I'm certainly not backing down! By the honour of my knighthood!"
Siegmeyer of Catarina,Killing him,"Heavens, me... My dear little Lin..."
Snuggly the Crow,When approached,"[cawing] You, you. [cawing] Give me, warm. Give me, soft. [cawing]"
Snuggly the Crow,Dropping something that can't be traded,"No, [cawing] no. That, no. [cawing] That no warm. That no soft. [cawing]"
Snuggly the Crow,Dropping something that's already been traded,"No, no. Not that one. [cawing] Enough, [cawing] enough."
Solaire of Astora,Introduction,"Ah, hello! You don't look Hollow, far from it! I am Solaire of Astora, an adherent of the Lord of Sunlight. Now that I am Undead, I have come to this great land, the birthplace of Lord Gwyn, to seek my very own sun! ...Do you find that strange? Well, you should! No need to hide your reaction. I get that look all the time! Hah hah hah!"
Solaire of Astora,Speaking again,"Oh, ah-hah! So, I didn't scare you? I have a proposition, if you have a moment."
Solaire of Astora,"Answering ""Yes""","The way I see it, our fates appear to be intertwined. In a land brimming with Hollows, could that really be mere chance? So, what do you say? Why not help one another on this lonely journey?"
Solaire of Astora,"Answering ""No""","Well, yes, quite understandable. Not to worry. I do not wish to impose. I was in the wrong. We'll laugh it off, shall we? Hah hah hah!"
Solaire of Astora,"Answering ""Yes"" to second question","This pleases me greatly! Well then, take this. We are amidst strange beings, in a strange land. The flow of time itself is convoluted; with heroes centuries old phasing in and out. The very fabric wavers, and relations shift and obscure. There's no telling how much longer your world and mine will remain in contact. But, use this, to summon one another as spirits, cross the gaps between the worlds, and engage in jolly co-operation! Of course, we are not the only ones engaged in this. But I am a warrior of the sun! Spot my summon signature easily by its brilliant aura. If you miss it, you must be blind! Hah hah hah!"
Solaire of Astora,"Answering ""No"" to second question","Well, yes, quite understandable. Not to worry. Not to worry. I do not wish to impose. I was in the wrong. We'll laugh it off, shall we? Hah hah hah!"
Solaire of Astora,"Speaking if the player answered ""No"" to second question","Oh, hello. You're still keen on speaking to me? Then, perhaps you have reconsidered my offer?"
Solaire of Astora,Speaking after hearing all dialogue in Undead Parish,"Oh, hello there. I will stay behind, to gaze at the sun. The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father! If only I could be so grossly incandescent!"
Solaire of Astora,Speaking in Anor Londo,"Oh, there you are. You've been quiet these days. Smooth summoning out there? Anytime you see my brilliantly shining signature, do not hesitate to call upon me. You've left me with quite an impression. I would relish a chance to assist you."
Solaire of Astora,Speaking a second time in Anor Londo,"You really are fond of chatting with me, aren't you? If I didn't know better, I'd think you had feelings for me! Oh, no, dear me. Pretend you didn't hear that! Hah hah hah!"
Solaire of Astora,Speaking to Solaire at Sunlight Altar,"Oh, hello there. I'm glad to see you alive ...You have done well, indeed you have. You've a strong arm, strong faith, and most importantly, a strong heart. I am in awe, really. Yes, yes...What do you think? Why not join me, as a warrior of the Sun? Righteous knights, guardians of all that is good, in the name of the Lord of Sunlight! ...Only if it would please you, of course. Well?"
Solaire of Astora,"Answering ""Yes""","Oh! Magnificent! I knew you would fancy it! Then, join the Covenant! Here, stay still for a moment... And there we are. Now, just say a prayer at the Altar of Sunlight, right there. Then you shall know the brilliance of our Sun."
Solaire of Astora,"Answering ""No""","Yes, well, each has one's beliefs. But if you change your mind, the offer is open."
Solaire of Astora,"Speaking if the player answered ""No""","Oh, hello there. What is it? Have you changed your mind about my offer?"
Solaire of Astora,Speaking after praying to the Sunlight Altar,"Oh, hello there. Exhilarating, is it not? The power of the Sun! I am blessed to have found such a brave companion! Hah hah hah!"
Solaire of Astora,Speaking again at the Sunlight Altar,"Hmm! Ah, oh... hello there. Forgive me, I was just pondering... about my poor fortune. I did not find my own sun, not in Anor Londo, nor in Twilight Blighttown. Where else might my sun be? Lost Izalith, or the Tomb of the Gravelord...? But I cannot give up. I became Undead to pursue this! But when I peer at the Sun up above, it occurs to me... What if I am seen as a laughing stock, as a blind fool without reason? Well, I suppose they wouldn't be far off! Hah hah hah!"
Solaire of Astora,Speaking in Demon Ruins,"After all this searching, I still cannot find it..."
Solaire of Astora,Speaking in shortcut to Lost Izalith,"Was it all a lie? Have I done this all, for nothing? Oh, my dear sun... What now, what should I do...? ...My sun, my dear, dear sun..."
Solaire of Astora,Screams if Solaire goes insane,"...Hrg, rg...Arrrgh... ...Finally, I have found it, I have!... ...My very own sun... I...am the sun!... ...I've done it...I have... ...Yes, I did it...I did!... ...Ohh, ohhh... ...Hrgrraaaooogh!"
Solaire of Astora,Attacking him,"Hrg! Ooh! Whoa! What the...! What's wrong with you?! If a stubborn beast you be, I have no choice! A Warrior of the Sun will not just sit and take it! Hrgraaah!"
Solaire of Astora,Killing him,"Why, you...How could this...? My... my sun..."
Solaire of Astora,Killing insane Solaire,"...Ahh, it's over... ...My Sun...it's setting... ...It's dark, so dark..."
Undead Female Merchant,Introduction,"Hmm, you still have your senses about you? Then why won't you buy some of my moss? I need your souls! Vee hee hee!"
Undead Female Merchant,Talk x1,"This is a wonderful place, don't you think? We have water, moss, moisture, these nice iron bars... I like it here, I really do. Nothing good ever happened to me in life. But now that I'm Undead, I've never been happier!"
Undead Female Merchant,Talk x2,"Tell me honestly... You think I've gone to the other side, don't you? That I've cracked my head and gone Hollow... You do, don't you? I can see it in your eyes. You'd trust a patch of moss over me..."
Undead Female Merchant,Leaving without purchase,Drat. What a humdrum lad you are.
Undead Female Merchant,Greetings,"Oh, there you are, dearie! A pleasure to see you again. Vee hee hee!"
Undead Female Merchant,Greetings after long absence,"Oh, hello, dearie! You left me high and dry for a while, there. I thought maybe you'd forgotten about me. Are you back for more of my moss, then? Plenty of it here. Freshly peeled, just for you! Vee hee hee!"
Undead Female Merchant,Leaving after making a purchase,"Come again, if you please! Vee hee hee!"
Undead Female Merchant,Talk x3,"Ah, go down along the side to reach the depths of the Undead Burg. Only unkempt crooks and liars to be found there. Hardly a place for a lady like myself! But who knows, maybe you'd fit right in? Vee hee hee hee hee!"
Undead Female Merchant,Leaving abruptly,"Hmph, fine, then. But you'll regret it."
Undead Female Merchant,Speaking after abruptly leaving,"Are you toying with me? One day, your fate will catch up with you. I have a sense for these things... The Gods above are watching you!"
Undead Female Merchant,Attacking her,"What do you think you're doing?! I have my pride, you damn fool! You think you can get away with murder? Yes, I suppose you think you're special! Well, you're not! You're just another customer! Burn! Burn in hell! You cross-eyed Hollow! There's no hope for anyone like you! The Gods will not have it! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die a thousand times again! Curses upon you! Upon you, and yours,for generations eternal! All of you! Eternal pain and suffering! Lots and lots! A curse upon you..."
Undead Female Merchant,Killing her,A curse upon you...
Undead Male Merchant,Introduction,"Well, now... You seem to have your wits about you, hmm? Then you are a welcome customer! I trade for souls. Everything's for sale! Nee hee hee hee hee!"
Undead Male Merchant,Greetings,"Oh, you again? I hope you've brought plenty of souls? Nee hee hee hee hee!"
Undead Male Merchant,Greetings x2,"Oh, there you are. Where have you been hiding? I guessed you'd hopped the twig for certain. Bah, shows what I know! Nee hee hee hee!"
Undead Male Merchant,Greetings x3,"Oh, there you are. Still keeping your marbles all together? Then, go ahead, don't be a nitwit. Never hurts to splurge when your days are numbered! Nee hee hee hee hee!"
Undead Male Merchant,Greetings (after being away for some time),"Oh, there you are.Where have you been hiding?I guessed you'd hoped the twig for certain.Bah, shows what I know!Nee hee hee hee hee!"
Undead Male Merchant,Talk 1x,"It's actually quite nice here, you know? The Hollows don't care for a skinny old twig like me. I've got Yulia...And nobody pelts me with stones anymore. You're Undead, you know how it is. I was treated worse back at home."
Undead Male Merchant,Talk 2x,"Eh? My wares? Of course they're stolen; what did you think? And when you lose your head, I'll sell it all again! Nee hee hee hee hee!"
Undead Male Merchant,Talk 3x,"Things are getting treacherous in these parts. A horrible goat demon has moved in below. And up above, there's that humongous drake, and a bull demon too. If you stick around this place, it might end up being your grave! Nee hee hee hee hee!"
Undead Male Merchant,Talk 4x,"Ah, this one? Ain't she lovely? Her name is Yulia. She's plumb in love with me. You'd never leave my side, now would you, Yulia?"
Undead Male Merchant,Talk 5x,"Ah, you can forget it. I'm all that she needs. Careful, she'll bite your little fingers off! Be kind, Yulia, be kind! Nee hee hee hee hee!"
Undead Male Merchant,Talk 6x,"Eh? I'm not here to chit-chat. We talk business, or we talk nothing at all."
Undead Male Merchant,Talk 7x,"Now, don't squander your time chatting! You need to look over my wares!"
Undead Male Merchant,Upon purchasing,Thank you kindly. Nee hee hee hee!
Undead Male Merchant,Upon purchasing 2x,"Ah, thank you, very much. Come back soon! Nee hee hee hee!"
Undead Male Merchant,Leaving without purchasing anything,Hmph. What a waste of time. Go and fall off a cliff.
Undead Male Merchant,Leaving without purchasing anything 2x,"Tsk! Throw me a bone, will you? You haven't got much time anyway. Right, Yulia?"
Undead Male Merchant,Leaving without purchasing anything 3x,"Hmph! Cheap bastard. Right, Yulia?"
Undead Male Merchant,Abruptly leave,"Hey, what! What's the matter?"
Undead Male Merchant,Speak to him after,What was that about?Oh. Nevermind.
Undead Male Merchant,Attacking him (while he's still docile),Eeg!
Undead Male Merchant,Attacking him x2 (while he's still docile),Yeowch!
Undead Male Merchant,Attacking him x3 (while he's still docile),"Oi, what's this about?"
Undead Male Merchant,Attacking him x4 (while he's still docile),"It's me! Stop it, I tell you!"
Undead Male Merchant,Attacking him and making him hostile,"You've gone mad, have you!? I'll teach you! You lousy rat! Yulia! Yulia!"
Undead Male Merchant,Killing him,"Why, me... Little Yulia..."
Vamos,Greeting,Be gone with you! ...You'll spoil my focus.
Vamos,Greeting x2,"...What's that, then? Need some smithing? Then produce me some wares!"
Vamos,Farewell without purchase,"Well, what was that about? Don't be coming around here without a good reason! "
Vamos,Farewell after making a purchase,"If that'll be all, then be gone with you, you'll spoil my focus..."
Vamos,Greeting after leaving the area,Bah! You rotten scoundrel!
Vamos,Leaving abruptly,Now where've you gone?
Vamos,Greeting after leaving abruptly,"...You've got rotten manners. If it be smithing you need, then produce your wares."
Vamos,Showing Large Flame Ember,"Hmph? Why, is that...... An ember from New Londo...... And a fine ember it be... What do you say? Why not leave it with me? I'll give you a flame to feast your eyes upon."
Vamos,Answering 'No',"Hmm, yes, I see... Well, do not hesitate if you should change your mind..."
Vamos,Answering 'Yes',"Yes, yes, very well! We'll get these old bones to work! Keh heh heh!"
Vamos,Showing Chaos Flame Ember,"...Hmph? Why, that's......an ember unlike any that I have seen......a very curious pattern...... Could it be the flame of the legendary witch? ...I know! Suppose you left that ember with me? Old Vamos would never let you down, no, not ever!"
Vamos,Anwering 'No',"Hmm, hmm... Fine, then... I doubt you'd even...bah, forget it... These bones won't fail me anytime soon. I'll come across another, eventually... Keh heh heh heh heh!"
Vamos,Answering 'Yes',"Yes, splendid, splendid indeed!... My, oh, my! You precious little thing..."
Vamos,Showing any other ember,"Hmph? Why, you have......an ember, do you? Ahh, forget about it. I don't deal with that kind. What has gone wrong with embers these days?"
Vamos,Talk,"...Hmph! I'm here to smith, not to chit chat. ...I've told you, I'm here for the trade, not for the talk! ...Enough with your presence. It disturbs me."
Vamos,Talk x2,"Well, you are a persistent one, are you not? But I'm afraid I'm a mere blacksmith, it's just me and my trade. I would be of no help to a righteous warrior such as yourself."
Vamos,Talk x3,"I've told you, I have nothing to discuss..."
Vamos,Talk x4,"If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more."
Vamos,Talk x5,"I'd be of more help with that ember from New Londo, of course... It's a shame the whole place was flooded..."
Vamos,Talk x6,"I've told you, I have nothing to discuss... If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more."
Vamos,Talk x7,"Speaking honestly, I must say that I'm at my very limit. There's no more work to be done. Ahh, unless I had the flame of that legendary witch... But that would require a visit to Lost Izalith. Impossible..."
Vamos,Attacking him,"Trying to cause trouble, are you? I am Vamos the blacksmith, and I'm no bag of bones!"
Vamos,Killing him,Curses...
Vince of Thorolund,Greetings,Hm? What have we here? You look awfully raggedy; are you all right? You look awfully raggedy... Times are grim; the least you can do is look sharp. Don't you dare meet M'lady like that. You might scare her off for good!
Vince of Thorolund,Talk 1x,"Oh, you again. What business have you? I don't suppose we can help, though. We accompany M'lady on her righteous mission. It is quite a chore, but I'm stuck with her, and Nico, too. I can't very well abandon them now."
Vince of Thorolund,Talk 2x,"Oh, you yet again. You're a persistent one, aren't you? Hah hah hah. Honestly, I don't have a problem with your kind. But there's not very much that I can do. I am Vince of Thorolund. Let's say a word, for our safety. A prayer to our marvellous Lord. Vereor Nox."
Vince of Thorolund,Talk 3x,"Oh, it's you? We are to leave momentarily. The Catacombs aren't exactly my idea of a good time, but...What can one do? I do hope we meet again. Vereor Nox."
Vince of Thorolund,Attacking him,Egads! What the! Curses! What the devil's wrong with you? I cannot overlook a threat to M'lady! I'll grind you into dust!
Vince of Thorolund,Killing him,By the Gods...... My...dear lady...
